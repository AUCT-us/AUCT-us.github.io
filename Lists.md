# The Importance of Curating Annotated Reading Lists

*Listification* is really about **HYBRID intelligence** ... it involves using and developing the various forms of human intelligence, eg mental, emotional, social, business, physicultural ... along with various forms of machine intelligence. 

Thus, annotated lists are the foundation of graph theoretic conceptual framework to drive the knowledge connections between various artistic, entrepreneurial, and creative scientific disciplines and subdisciplines. Annotated lists the basis of semiotic and semantic graphs ... it's really a matter of growing a noosphere with organic or almost mycorrhizal conceptual pathways. Starting with lists and checkist as priorizable outlines ... adding annoations and connections ... editing and revising, to think in graphs like connected papers and maybe standard format like either CSV, JSON or graphQL data APIs.


The EXERCISE of continually curating annotated reading lists is really about the routine discipline of little tasks, eg daily reading, that advance the personal discipline as well as mental/social fitness ... without the regular exercise of different knowledge development *muscles* atrophy occurs, especially in areas of knowledge where communities evolve and grow or die, the language and terminology changes, where different minds become more or less engaged.
