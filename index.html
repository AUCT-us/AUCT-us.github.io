<a id="opensourcist" class="anchor" href="#opensourcist" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Be a real warrior in a REAL war. Be REAL in life. The essence of being a warrior is to never quit on yourself.</h3>

<p>Being a REAL warrior is NOT about anything that is fake. It is not about faking it. Being a warrior is NOT about playing GI Joe or acting as if you're ready to step into some bullshit fight scene from a movie or a video game. It is NOT about games, NEVER about picking on the weak.  Being a REAL warrior is certainly NOT about being any kind of bully. Being a warrior is NOT about being an insensitive, callous brute or carelessly causing collateral damage.

<p>Being a warrior is about having the courage, discipline and will to DO THE RIGHT THING ... sometimes, doing the right thing is "fessin up" to having made a mistake and having failed to having done the right thing.  Warriors are flexible ... so sometimes the right thing to do is to pull back, retreat, to prepare to attack ... it's not about living or dying, it is about accomplishing the mission.  But the right thing is NEVER about quitting on yourself. NEVER. EVER.</p>

<p>The shortest ditance to accomplishing your mission is THROUGH your enemy, through your worst fear.  This is not about making STUPID, senseless, bull-headed sacrifices that accomplish nothing. Being a real warrior is about mindfulness and fighting smart.  It is a never ending process of LEARNING how to LEARN, LEARNING how to try things that might fail ... it can thought of as a five-part iterative collection of subprocesses. All of the parts are related and they don't have to be done in sequence after the first cycle, but it is best to focus on one part at time.</p>

<p>1) THINK with critical test-driven development mindset. Get into the game. Test often, rapidly, continually. Think of development as a set of simple, straightforward, nontrivial TESTABLE HYPOTHESES.</p>

<p>2) ENGAGE and CULTIVATE SITUATIONS that invite give-and-take, trial-and-error.  Listen to those who you have engaged; listen especially to their reaction to your testable hypothesis.</p>

<p>3) DEVELOP YOUR LISTENING APTITUDES. Get out there and ask the right question. Refine your technique. Don't worry about being seen as tough or knowledgable. Zip it up and listen.</p>

<p>4) ANALYZE THE FULL RESPONSE in order to make better sense of the data by improving your technique. Do your homework, stay engaged and to ensure that people know you really care.</p>

<p>5) FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU MIGHT BUILD NEXT as the "scaffolding" for the infrastructure to form and test the next round hypotheses. Rapidly deliver simple prototype than be tested, then improved.</p>

<p>The reason for NEVER quitting on yourself has NOTHING to do with pride. The reason for not quitting is that tomorrow does not belong to you -- tomorrow belongs to God and God will decide when to take tomorrow from you. Tomorrow is a customer of today and the day after that will be a customer of tomorrow. You don't get to quit because you don't own your eternity -- God does.</p>

<p>Push as hard as you can but not harder than you can.  Take small steps so that your failures are small. Risk small failure without pushing into the catastrophic failure zone ... that is what being in a zone of Peak Learning ... or something like that, but you must play with it and make it your own.</p>

<p>Get comfortable with an element of discomfort, but do not masochistically push into the zone of pain. It is necessary to live in order to fight another day.</p>

<p>Slow and steady and <b>persistently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbiGC7Ga_Ag" target="_blank">finding a way to STEP UP and help</a></b> wins the battle.</p>
