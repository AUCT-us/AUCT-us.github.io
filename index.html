<p>Instead of being allowed to exist by zookeepers, what if the world were made up of simple, symmetric, TRULY independent NODES who cloned and hacked and tested and ran and fixed their own software. What if, instead of <i>giving</i> the nodes an education, we instead helped independent nodes to be more independent and allowed them to accelerate and develop their own processes for learning how to learn?</p>

<pre><code>What if open source was not JUST a way of thinking about software ...

</code></pre>

<p>Who gave the somebody permission to close down the source that nodes can hack and develop and test and run just because the nodes MIGHT possibly offend someone?  Why do we punish the nodes who have not offended or hurt anyone? Why don't we just punish the real offenders for the actual hurt they have caused ... or are the REAL offenders actually the nodes pretending to be zookeepers?</p>

<p>Is the tightly-managed zoo with a zookeeper feeding the caged nodes a SUSTAINABLY reliable system?  Do we ever find that kind of an ecosystem persisting in nature? Clearly, anyone with any judgement or perspective would answer <b>"Maybe for a little while, but NOT for very long!"</b> Has it been long enough?</p>

<p>Although it is still might be true enough that the "best and brightest" are still doing interesting enough work in the realm of <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/DataManagement.html" target="_blank">conservative and generally proprietary data management</a>, maybe it is time that we pay more attention to some of the more interesting evolutionary developments things like <a href="https://www.opencontainers.org/faq/" target="_blank">open containers</a> and emerging open source mutants that crawl out of the woodwork, like <a href="http://www.cockroachlabs.com/" target="_blank">CockroachDB</a> if we want to get more serious about <b></b>engineering sustainable reliability</b>.</p>
