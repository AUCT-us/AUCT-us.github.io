<p>Instead of being allowed to exist by zookeepers, what if the world were made up of simple, symmetric, TRULY independent NODES who cloned and hacked and tested and ran and fixed their own software.</p>

<pre><code>What if open source was not JUST a way of thinking about software ...

</code></pre>

<p>Who gave the somebody permission to close down the source that nodes can run just because the nodes MIGHT possibly offend someone?  Why do we punish the people who have not offended hurt anyone? Why don't we just punish the real offenders ... or are they the zookeepers?</p>

<p>Is this zoo a SUSTAINABLY reliable system?  Clearly, the answer is <b></b>"Not for very LONG!"</b></p>
