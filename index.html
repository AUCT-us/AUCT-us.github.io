<p>“What if we take the relationships and connections in our data and reimagined our business along those relationships? What would that look like?”</p>

<p>Asking this "What If" question is definitional. Conway's law tells us that many companies will simply not be able to imagine asking this question ... moreover, many people inside those companies would never in a million years think of asking a question like this because they have been conditioned to think in terms of static, pre-defined roles. Culture, companies and most people change very slowly ... speed of delivery [of better solutions] demands that people amp up their game when it comes to changing. Graphs might matter to us, but only because social relationships are DYNAMIC; it is necessary to think about evolution, change and how the knowledge furnished will change and be used..</p>
