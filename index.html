<p>Instead of being allowed to exist by zookeepers, what if the world were made up of simple, symmetric, TRULY independent NODES that made up their own software.</p>

<pre><code>What if open source was not JUST a way of thinking about software ...

</code></pre>

<p>Who gave the somebody permission to shut down what nodes can do just because the nodes MIGHT possibly offend someone?  Why don't we punish offenders? Why do we punish the people who don't hurt anyone?</p>

<p>Is this a reliable system?  Clearly, the answer is <b></b>"Not for long!"</b></p>
