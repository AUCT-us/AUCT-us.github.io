<p>Instead of being allowed to exist by zookeepers, what if the world were made up of simple, symmetric, TRULY independent NODES who cloned and hacked and tested and ran and fixed their own software. What if, instead of <i>giving</i> the nodes an education, we instead helped independent nodes to be more independent and allowed them to accelerate and develop their own processes for learning how to learn?</p>

<pre><code>What if open source was not JUST a way of thinking about software ...

</code></pre>

<p>Who gave the somebody permission to close down the source that nodes can hack and develop and test and run just because the nodes MIGHT possibly offend someone?  Why do we punish the nodes who have not offended or hurt anyone? Why don't we just punish the real offenders for the actual hurt they have caused ... or are the REAL offenders actually the nodes pretending to be zookeepers?</p>

<p>Is this zoo a SUSTAINABLY reliable system?  Clearly, the answer is <b></b>"Not for very LONG!"</b></p>
