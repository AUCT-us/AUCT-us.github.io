<p>There is no genuine peace in this lifetime. Anyone who tells you otherwise is telling you lies. You might desparately want to believe those lies, but even though it is VERY important to be kind, gentle, caring, empathetic ... to NOT replicate and multiply chaos and violence ... but if you think just doing that is enough, you don't understand human history, you don't understand the Bible, you don't understand genuine compassion ... and YOU are dangerous to yourself and any others who look up to you.</p>

<p>It is impossible to ever be lean enough, rugged enough, secure enough ... achieving perfection in these realms is thoroughly unattainable in this life ... but as long as you want to live and to help others live, you must try.</p>

<pre><code>Get comfortable with humility driven by your recent failures.</pre></code>

<p>If you have not failed, you have not tried hard enough. The most arrogant, abusive, worthless assholes on the planet never fail -- they just blame others.</p>

<p><b>So endeavor to fail!</b></p>

<p>The essence of being a warrior is trying harder, failing and, in spite of the reality of being humbled ever day, never ever giving up on yourself.  Doing that for organizations is what the HarmFarm.ORG business model is all about ... <i>more on this later posts...<i></p>
