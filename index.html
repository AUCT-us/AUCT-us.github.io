<p>The <a href="https://github.com/MarkBruns/MarkBruns.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE.md" target="_blank">Danton General Public License</a> empowers you to be revolutionary fighter for freedom. Freedom entails obligations and cost. The Danton General Public License obliges you to THINK for yourself and to voluntarily engage in fighting to expand freedom and defend liberty for others ... you are empowered by the Danton General Public License, but you are encouraged be careful with your revolution. [As the French Revolution teaches us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Danton), when you let power go to your head, you'll lose it!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/MarkBruns/MarkBruns.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE.md" target="_blank">Danton General Public License</a> is almost exactly like the GNU General Public License, except that the Danton Public License obliges users to THINK about consequences of software architecture on how individuals, organizations and governments operate.</p>

<p>Specifically, we must think about the consequences of [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) which states <i>"organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."</i></p>

<p>Conversely, Danton's Law states that <i>"Software architecture defines an organization's ability to patiently learn about customer or client needs and to kindly and justly serve those needs.  It is the responsibility of those who understand software architecture to refuse to participate in enabling the COERCIVE concentration of wealth and power that always results in a democidal reign of terror."</i></p>

<p>It is worth re-iterating that we are not especially worried about power and wealth accumulating those those on the the basis of merit.  For example: competition in the free marketplace rewards organizations that produce good products and provide good service with more resources while simultaneously denying access to resources to those who provide less than satisfactory products and services.</p>

<p><b>Competition expands freedom; coercive restriction on competition removes freedom.</b></p>
