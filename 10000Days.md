# NEVER look in the rear view mirror ... never aspire to living life as either an entitled tourist, a nursing home patient or some kind of victim.

You can take breaks or lay down to take a nap when you are exhausted, but you should live looking forward to what you still have left to do. 

That's why you should always have a pyramidal planning horizon.

* VISION/KNOW YOUR WHY
* PLAN/STRATEGIZE
* D0/IMPLEMENT 
* CHECK/MEASURE
* ACT/ADJUST/FIGHT

The important part of this pyramid is that the daily actions always inform what your are going to be checking on and measuring most closely ... just as your ability to control, observe, check, measure has to impact what your are doing or implementing ... and what you can confidently do or implement will affect your general strategy and planning ... and your planning will will impact your vision or your WHY ... but **it's constantly reflective** 

Your WHY drives your PLAN drives your DOING drives your CHECKING drives your ACTIONS ... and your actions influence what you check which influences how/what bigger things you do as your confidence in doing things affects your planning and strategy and the success/failure of those plans drives your vision. 

**The mindful life is a matter constant, unceasing reflection on this pyramid structure.**

The scale of the pyramid is something that you can play with or make work for you.  I used to do project management using holidays, eg Super Bowl Sunday, Thanksgiving, as key dates for big milestones ... the holiday was a way for everyone involved to think about a push to achieving milestone, because people are social creatures and they do not necessarily really think in terms of days -- they tend to think in terms of events, celebrations, family gatherings, parties with friends.

In my personal life, however ... days work better, because I don't tend to especially recognize or celebrate holidays as a person, any more ... maybe I did when I was a kid, but now ... a 100 days push is either 3 months, 1 week and a couple days for getting re-organized/regrouped OR three sets of four week sprints, with two week half-sprint and two days for getting re-organized/regrouped ... so I like 100 day planning windows AND the fact that 10,000 days is 100 100-day planning windows ... but others might find a different framework than 10,000 works better.

### Compare different time scales to find what works for you.

Just please do not treat time/project management as unnecesssay ... please do not go through life, just living one day after another, killing time ... think in terms of the BIG WHY, with the Plan, Do, Check, Act reflective cycle ... which drives each DAY.

* 1 day, 10 days, 100 days, 1000 days, 10,000 days (27 1/3 years)
* 1 day, 7 days, 49 days, 343 days, 2401 days (6 1/2 years)
* 1 day, 5 days, 25 days, 125 days, 625 days (1 2/3 years)
* 1 day, 3 days, 9 days, 

Keep your horizon, until you KNOW that your horizon has changed -- you will KNOW when the end is definitely sooner ... and when that end is DEFINITELY sooner -- your planning horizon will, but you can still think about it in the same five order time horizon.

# VISUALIZE the architecture of the future of your life

Think in terms of the LONG TERM ... your idea of the long term might vary ... for me, I think about the next 10,000 days or approximately 27 years and 4 and 1/2 months ... there are practical reasons why 10,000 days makes sense for me. 10,000 days is roughly in line with what is the **AVERAGE** life expectation is for someone of my age and my level of health/fitness, ie someone in their early 60s with no immediately threatening health conditions. 

After all, a good proportion of people in their early 60s already have some showstopper medical condition, something that demands regular daily medication OR they really need a marijauna supplement or stiff drink or two or three every day to deal with stress OR are perhaps are a cancer survivor still on heavy pharma therapy regime OR already have some heart condition or hypertension issue OR might already be a Type II diabetic. The point is that [AVERAGE life expectancy for the ENTIRE populations of 62 year old males is about 20 years](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html), but the life expectancy for HEALTHY males is probably closer being around 90 ON AVERAGE. 

Of course, there are no gaurantee ... so we enjoy working on what matters to us and by working on these things, we get to LIVE life NOW ... without ever thinking that we are old so we DESERVE to live like a tourist, or some senile retiree just on an AARP vacation ... rather than ***building*** for the next 10,000 days.

# PLAN concretely for the next 1000 days ... but these strategies will change

The point of planning is to DRIVE looking forward ... of course, you will  adapt, steer, guide, revise, but you will need a destination or as you develop your PLANS for the next 1000 days ... this is the foreseeable vision part of the PDCA cycle

# DO in the next 100 days

Using something like an AGILE work breakdown structure which you will manage and check in the next 10 days, IMPLEMENT the next phase of the plan in the next 100 days ... roll up your sleeves and do the necessary sprints, thinking about what your objective will be over the next three or four months. This is roughly analogous to the growing season in farming.

# CHECK the impact of your 10 day sprint

Develop your daily workflow with 10 day sprint horizons.

# Each day, ACT upon the one Big Thing that is MOST important for today
