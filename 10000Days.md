I look forward to the next 10,000 days with great anticipation!

10,000 days are approximately 27 years and 4 and 1/2 months ... that is roughly what the life expectation is for someone of my age and my level of health/fitness, ie someone in their early 60s with no immediately threatening health conditions ... a good proportion of people in their early 60s already are on some sort of regular medication or need a drink every day, are perhaps a cancer survivor or already have some heart/hypertension issue, might be at risk for Type II diabetes ... so a life expectancy of around 90 is about average for someone in their early 60s who's healthy and free of addictions.  

I dunno if I am always happy about the likelihood of living to be 90 or older, but THAT is what the EXPECTATION is ... ON AVERAGE, for a male in his his early 60s, in good health ... and, if that were not scary enough, half of us will live longer. Thus, my 10,000 day horizon for optimizing my healthspan and professional/mental well-being is approximately appropriate for ME ... of course, your mileage may vary, but the most important thing is ... mere HOPE is completely insufficient. 

## You must LIVE out YOUR life ... live according to your time horizon.

**YOU HAVE TO LIVE LOOKING FORWARD, BECAUSE WHEN YOU START LIVING LOOKING IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR, YOU ARE BASICALLY DEAD, JUST A NUISANCE, TAKING UP SPACE WHILE THEY WAIT FOR THE UNDERTAKER TO DO SOMETHNG WITH THE BODY.**
