# BUILD for the next 10,000 days ... never live as a tourist

You should always have a 10,000 day horizon -- until you KNOW that the end is definitely sooner ... when that end is sooner -- your planning horizon changes, but you can think about it in the same five order time horizon.

10,000 days are approximately 27 years and 4 and 1/2 months ... that is roughly what the **AVERAGE** life expectation is for someone of my age and my level of health/fitness, ie someone in their early 60s with no immediately threatening health conditions. After all, a good proportion of people in their early 60s already have some showstopper medical condition, something that demands regular daily medication OR they really need a marijauna supplement or stiff drink or two or three every day to deal with stress OR are perhaps are a cancer survivor still on heavy pharma therapy regime OR already have some heart condition or hypertension issue OR might already be a Type II diabetic. The point is that [AVERAGE life expectancy for the ENTIRE populations of 62 year old males is about 20 years](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html), but the life expectancy for HEALTHY males is probably closer being around 90 ON AVERAGE. 

Of course, there are no gaurantee ... so we enjoy working on what matters to us and by working on these things, we get to LIVE life NOW ... without ever thinking that we are old so we DESERVE to live like a tourist, or some senile retiree just on an AARP vacation ... rather than ***building*** for the next 10,000 days.

# PLAN concretely for the next 1000 days ... but these strategies will change

The point of planning is to DRIVE looking forward ... of course, you will  adapt, steer, guide, revise, but you will need a destination or as you develop your PLANS for the next 1000 days ... this is the foreseeable vision part of the PDCA cycle

# DO in the next 100 days

Using something like an AGILE work breakdown structure which you will manage and check in the next 10 days, IMPLEMENT the next phase of the plan in the next 100 days ... roll up your sleeves and do the necessary sprints, thinking about what your objective will be over the next three or four months. This is roughly analogous to the growing season in farming.

# CHECK the impact of your 10 day sprint

Develop your daily workflow with 10 day sprint horizons.

# Each day, ACT upon the one Big Thing that is MOST important for today
