I look forward to the next 10,000 days with great anticipation!

10,000 days are approximately 27 years and 4 and 1/2 months ... that is roughly what the **AVERAGE** life expectation is for someone of my age and my level of health/fitness, ie someone in their early 60s with no immediately threatening health conditions ... 

After all, a good proportion of people in their early 60s already are on some sort of regular daily medication OR really need a marijauna supplement or stiff drink or two or three every day to deal with stress OR are perhaps are a cancer survivor still on heavy pharma therapy regime OR already have some heart condition or hypertension issue OR might already be a Type II diabetic.

The point is that [average life expectancy for the ENTIRE populations of 62 year old males is about 20 years](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html), but large proportion of those people already have life-threatening ailmts ... so the life expectancy for HEALTHY males of around 90 ... that's about average for someone has made it to their early 60s, who's basically healthy, completely free of addictions and works out every day.  

There's no gaurantee and living a long life means that you had better enjoy life right now, because it is not going to get easier. 

MOST of the time, I am pretty darned happy about the likelihood of living to be 90 or older, but NOT ALWAYS ... it doesn't matter what I want, 10,000 days is the EXPECTATION I must prepare for.  I cannot merely HOPE for a medical bailout or that I will be well taken care of ... I must develop a plan and WORK that plan ... I must expect to live 10,000 days AND I must plan for the contingency that I live to 100 or more, because I have great aunts, uncles and other family members who have made it to their late 90s, early 100s.

## You must LIVE out YOUR life ... live according to your time horizon.

**YOU HAVE TO LIVE LOOKING FORWARD, BECAUSE WHEN YOU START LIVING LOOKING IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR, YOU ARE BASICALLY DEAD, JUST A NUISANCE, TAKING UP SPACE WHILE THEY WAIT FOR THE UNDERTAKER TO DO SOMETHNG WITH THE BODY.**
