I look forward to the next 10,000 days with great anticipation!

10,000 days are approximately 27 years and 4 months ... that is roughly what the life expectation is for someone of my age, my level of health, ie no immediately threatening health conditions ... it's not an extravagant claim -- anyone of my age who's in relatively decent health ... is going to live another 10,000 ON AVERAGE ... and half of us will live longer.

Thus, my 10,000 day horizon for optimizing my healthspan and mental well-being is approximately appropriate for ME ... your mileage may vary, but the most important thing is ...

...**YOU HAVE TO LIVE LOOKING FORWARD, BECAUSE WHEN YOU START LIVING LOOKING IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR, YOU ARE BASICALLY DEAD, TAKING UP SPACE WHILE THEY WAIT FOR THE UNDERTAKER TO DO SOMETHNG WITH THE BODY.**

*yes, I meant to YELL...*
