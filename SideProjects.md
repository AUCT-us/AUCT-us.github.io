The point of side projects, ventures, startups for me is learn how to learn better than I currently know how to learn ... to some degree, I also want these  things to have a positive economic impact, ie to either lower my expenses OR to to be source of income. But the point of doing projects for me is not to get rich or to even solve a problem ... I mainly use side projects to more aggressively interact with people who I find interesting, to accelerate my negotiations by having actual skin in the game, to get a more realistic, practical and useful understanding of problems ... maybe these ideas and investigations will amount to something, but mostly they are just about learning how to learn in order to be antifragile or to be ready to be able to make the best of uncertainty and chaos and possibly profit from or *enjoy* the world of problems.

#### Please suggest projects that I should be involved in; I will trust that you know how [use a pull request](https://github.com/MarkBruns/MarkBruns.github.io/pulls)

There's certainly nothing magic or particularly methodical about my approach ... it's pretty damned chaotic and disorganized ... and the list is most definitely NOT prioritized.
