<a id="opensourcist" class="anchor" href="#opensourcist" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is Go language trending?</h3>

<p>Look at the <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=golang" target="_blank">interest in Go Language (golang)</a>.  It is not exactly unexpected, but the fundamental reason that interest in Go is exploding has very little if anything to do with Google's support for the language. After all, Google's power is far from absolute when it comes to creating demand for something that does not work. To its credit, Google is still innovating and changing like crazy and the proof of this is that Google is somewhat famous for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_products#Discontinued_products_and_services" target="_blank">discontinued initiatives</a> such as Google Wave or Google Code.</p>

<p>Go was a deliberate, engineered attempt by deeply experienced, intensely practical, really SMART people to develop a solid language that genuinely made programmers more productive in the work that they have to do today, on today's problems ... and somehow, that actually seems to be working out almost exactly as hoped, but probably NOT exactly for the reasons that were expected.</p>

<p>The people who are using Go don't behave the politically-correct, uber-nice, Google-conduct way that managers leading Go language development at Google would like these people to conduct themselves. For exmple ... Google managers have realized that <i><a href="http://blog.golang.org/open-source" target="_blank">the open source tech community in general and the Go community in particular is skewed toward people who communicate BLUNTLY.</a></i></p>

<p>The broader Go community knows what is working and what is not in the environments where Go is being used ... especially in where Go is being used to create truly disruptive products (eg. Docker, CoreOS, CockroachDB). The folks at Google [where Go was invented] don't necessarily know what works, what doesn't.</p>

<p>The reason that Go language is trending is that Go language has left the Google nest and has taken on a truly OPEN SOURCE life of its own.</p>
