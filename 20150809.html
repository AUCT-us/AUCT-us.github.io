<a id="opensourcist" class="anchor" href="#opensourcist" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tell me how I can be of service to you!</h3>

<p>"Tell me how I can be of service to you!" is currently what I want to be my epitaph.  Someday maybe, I will want something else ... for that's it for now.  I want to make it my personal brand ... so, among other things, it's my tagline on LinkedIn.</p>

<pre><code>One must serve others WITHOUT expecting anything in return.</pre></code>

<p>It is important to look for ways to serve the RIGHT people.</p>

<p>I serve people who have demonstrated a commitment to serve others, those who work on more farsighted, farreaching projects which serve a greater common good, eg open source software. I avoid helping people who are only needy and demanding; I work at avoiding crybabies, gossipers, blamers, liars and people who jealous of others. I am not a big fan of either self-promoters or small thinkers. I look for humble people who try to really BIG things and fail.</p>

<p>I am EXTREMELY serious about improving my "Workflow of Service" so I am blogging about the topic, writing code, attempting to automate the process and share my work in a Github repository named Workflow-As-Code.  I believe that workflow is a manifestation of the effectiveness of a personal philosophy, personal operating system, personal application code. I want other people to fork the repo, steal my brand, do a better job with it and show me better ways.</p>

<pre><code>Workflow-As-Code is about service, training and independence.</pre></code>

<p>Being sustainably independent is primarily a matter of constant vigilance and working to develop an awareness of how one can provide service to a large pool of the right people.<p>

<p>One thing is a look at which kinds of businesses are getting funding, which ones are doing big things, which ones are hiring and what kinds of NEW resources they might need.  The marktplace tells me how my old, already-acquired skills and resources and capital match up with the most KEY things they need to grow ... I am interested in understanding their constraints so that I can apply my resources where they are especially needed. Looking at venture deal flow or searching job listings is primarily about trying to predict what WILL be important while also sharpening one's depth of understanding of what will always be important.</p>

<p>I care a lot about being more lean, more rugged, more reliable and fault tolerant, but I also look at security, threats, vulnerabilities ... I try to stay a step ahead of bad guys ... I NEVER, EVER, EVER fall for the comfortable LIE that the world is made of basically nice people who are just trying to get along ... I believe that "idiot compassion " is actually far worse than no compassion ... <i>more on that later</i></p>
