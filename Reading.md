We love competition.

We follow a lot of different GAMES ... in war, technology, culture, propaganda and even sometimes in some sports that are actually about competition and improvement, eg wrestling RATHER than sports that primarily about distraction/entertainment, eg NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB.

Mostly, we are not interested in furthering spectator games ... we favor ACTIVE, PARTICIPATORY, REAL games ... we don't have significant interest in computer gaming EXCEPT what technologies it has fostered in the realm of NVIDIA vs AMD vs INTEL vs Samsung vs TSMC and the competitive DIY sport of gaming rig builds and tweeking the tech for greater computational speed. 

We tend to be speedreaders, abstract skimmers and EXTREMELY HEAVY consumers of data, information, fora interaction, [inane] commentary and various repositories of code, models, papers and demo sandboxes ... the competitive nature extends to how we grok information that is somewhat pertinent to the game we are following.

But, we mostly read and curate lists as a break from work ... TO RELAX ... but, even when we relax, we do try to use reading aids like multimodal AI to give us outlines or syllabi ... so that we can speedread *with serious, critical intention* TO IMPROVE OUR OVERALL ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE ***READING*** GAME. 

# Game-driven Reading Lists

Our aim with this listing is to never have to think about our next list of items to read/annotate ... we want to have roughly 125 good game ideas in the hopper ... to have 25 that we play with and work on at least once a month ... to have five that are part of our daily drills and things we are certain revisit at least once a week ... so that we can have ONE main GAME that we are focusing on getting right.

1) Health, nutrition, fitness, wellness, longevity, anti-aging, biohacking, nootropics, supplements, fasting, sleep, stress, mental health, addiction, recovery, trauma, PTSD, depression, anxiety, bipolar, schizophrenia, autism, ADHD, OCD, personality disorders, eating disorders, body awareness, body image, body dysmorphia, body positivity, body neutrality, body acceptance, body love, body respect, body trust, body sovereignty, body autonomy, body agency, body consent, body boundaries, body safety, body security, body privacy, body dignity, body integrity, body justice, body liberation, body revolution, body transformation, body evolution, body transcendence

2) Prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, long projects, meditation especially techniques like lojong 

3) Martial arts, self-defense, healing, yoga, tai chi, qigong, modern medicine vs traditional medicine, systematic improvement in health and exercise

4) Startup ecosystems, startup nations, not just the billion-dollar valuation unicorns but successful startups that make it to having a legitimate ten-million-dollar or million-dollar valuation, e-residency and virtual realm cultures that tap new global markets and pools of talent

5) The art of knowledge engineering, information dashboards and newsreaders for drinking from the firehose of peer-reviewed scientific journals and similar sources of current research and development activities 

6) Ecosystems, nature, not just parks and green spaces but the microscopic realm

7) Sculpture, particularly landsculpting, sustainable architecture [built to last hundreds/thousands of years, not just modern trash quick fab housing built to last a several decades or a century at most]

8) Meta Wikipedia, rabid wikipedians, the more general culture of online fora and combative debate of which wikiediting culture might be the best example

9) Classics and commentary, the culture of literature, poetry and the purification of language, philosophy and theology

10) Physicis, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology 

11) Computer Science and AI vs Unabomber Manifest, NLP, Computer Vision, Swarm Robotics and AIoT, Automation vs Simplification, Cybersecurity and the limits of cryptography, Quantum Computing, Metaverse and augmented reality, Smart Infrastructure vs Natural/Emergent [No] Infrastructure

12) Podcastering, DAWs, audio ... and cultural participation through the audio realm ... generally, we detest vidiots and the zombified culture of people programmed by their media choices in the visual realm ... in other words, we view audio as something we might listen to while RESTING ... we are completely uninteresting any anything that we passively watch while being entertained ... when we want to be entertained or completely immersed in a distracting experience, we DO physical activities, drills/calisthenics and things like gardening.

13) Music, Music AI and recommendation engines, Music metadata and signature analysis, music theory and the culture of music, music as a form of communication and a form of cultural PARTICIPATION ... we generally eschew any form of spectator culture ... we have no interest in being part of large mob watching a celebrity perform ... IF THERE'S ANY FORM OF CELEBRITY AND CELEBRITY WORSHIP INVOLVED, WE REGARD THE ACTIVITY AS POISON
