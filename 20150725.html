<a id="opensourcist" class="anchor" href="#opensourcist" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I learned at OSCON</h3>

<p>The Captain Obvious finding is that OSCON is a reflection of the fact that the conference put on by O'Rielly, THE major force in publishing [about open source] -- OSCON is for people who genuinely love exploring lots of ideas, these are people who READ and THINK a lot and put ideas into action in the information/communication industry which continues to be the infrastructure behind the development of science and knowledge ... the OSCON attendees are the READERS are [quietly] revolutionizing how other humans interact and think.</p>

<p> I should have realized that before ... and maybe I did subconsciously, when I registered for OSCON ... but I did not really GET it, until AFTER attending OSCON.</p>
<pre><code>OSCON reminds us that leadership is primarily about COMMUNITIES.</pre></code>

<p>Open source is only just beginning to change the world. Companies that are organized to be built by open sourcist developer have revolutionary advantage that is about freedom and responsibility.</p>

<p>Hype about things like microservices and Go language will come and go, but solid ideas will survive the hype ... sometimes there's a needle in the haystack of hype -- microservices, for example, will continue to be important BECAUSE they aid and build COMMUNITIES of open source DevOps engineers. Think about the best definition of microservices: Loosely-coupled service-oriented architecture with bounded contexts.</p>

<p>It is importatn to think about Conway's law -- organizational coupling is inescapable; you cannot really have reliable software with a reliable structure of independent, free, responsible development engineers -- the larger community [outside the company] matters more than what is happening inside the company. Microservices allow for the invertion of Conway's Law -- teams own service groups and backend stores, so it is possible to separate concerns and FOCUS on key processes and core competencies of the business with microservices. One developer can independently produce a microservice, each microservice can be deployed in a container, Tomcat, AMI, or Docker or ... this allows for flexible, stateless business logic ... making is possible to raises herds of productive cattle, rather than waste time babying pet projects.<b>The freedom and responsibility of devops culture is primarily FUELED by the community of developers.</b></p>
