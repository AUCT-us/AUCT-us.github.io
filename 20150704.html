<p>People get completely sidetracked by WHAT they have, WHAT they have done ... they ask "What does it matter?"</p>

<p>It is not about WHAT.  What is an artifact of HOW.</p>

<p>So a lot of people understand that HOW matters ... but also get it wrong, because they are completely mesmerized with HOW something is going to happen.</p>

<pre><code>Without a WHY, HOW and WHAT do not matter.</code></pre>

<p>Very few people really think about WHY they do something.</p>

<p>WHY is a very, very, very, very, very HARD question to answer</p>

<p>But without WHY, we have no legitimate focus -- we are just shooting in the general direction of what might be the target.</p>

<p>WHAT we do or HOW we do it is pinned down by WHY it matters.</p>

<p>How do we serve our WHY?</p>

<p>WHAT is the one thing that has to happen to advance the HOW?</p>
