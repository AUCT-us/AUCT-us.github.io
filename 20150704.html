<p>It is not about WHAT we do or have.  WHAT is an artifact or result of HOW we did, or HOW we set objectives.</p>

<p>Most people get completely sidetracked by WHAT they have, WHAT they have done ... they ask "What should I do? What can I do? What is the best thing to do?"</p>

<p>It is not about WHAT.  What is an artifact of HOW.</p>

<p>So a lot of people imagine that are ahead of the curve because they understand that HOW matters ... but also get it wrong, because they are completely mesmerized with the HOW of it.  And the problem is that HOW does not matter.</p>

<p>HOW might be a better target, more "agile" perhaps, than WHAT, maybe.  But it is not about HOW.  HOW is an artifact of WHY.</p>

<p>It is all about WHY.</p>

<p>Without a WHY, HOW and WHAT do not matter.  What HAS TO BE an artifact of HOW and HOW HAS TO BE an artifact of WHY.</p>

<p>Otherwise, we get "the cart in front of the horse" because we have shirked our responsibilities to ask deep, probing questions that only we can ask of ourselves and, as a result, we <a href="http://www.tricycle.com/train-your-mind-don%E2%80%99t-transfer-ox%E2%80%99s-load-cow" target="_blank">tranfer the ox's load to the cow</a> when we try to let someone else do the thinking about WHY.</p>

<pre><code>It's VERY important to get the WHY right, MORE IMPORTANT than anything else.</code></pre>

<p>Very few people really think about WHY when they do something. Mostly they just do something to keep busy and feel a sense of accomplishment for doing WHAT.</p>

<p>Wanting to to duck the question is understandable.  After all, drilling down to the real WHY of one's existence is a very, very, very, very, very HARD question to answer. NOBODY can answer that question for you.</p>

<p>But without WHY, we can have no legitimate focus -- we are just shooting in the general direction of what might be the target or worse we are allowing some WHAT, eg the acquisition of wealth, power, or fame for the sake of wealth, power or fame, to pull us off-target ... away from our beautiful and agile craft of HOW ... and far away from our existential meaning, our WHY.</p>

<p>This is not exactly a new concept; it is not just some New Age mysticism.  In the parlance of the operations-hardened, battle-tested Theory of Constraints literature, for example, all that matters is THE GOAL. We can get lost in How we are going to do something or What we are doing [to justify our salary], but none of that matters unless we have a HOW and a WHAT that serve our GOAL, our WHY!</p>

<p>WHAT and HOW without a decent WHY are pure, unadulterated waste ... focusing on the WHAT and HOW are the ticket to a smug, mindless, soulless, resource-destroying zombie life.</p>

<pre><code>Welcome to America!</code></pre>

<p>WHY is really about genuine INDEPENDENCE.  Without our own WHY, there is absolutely no way that we can authentically declare our INDEPENDENCE and affirm that INDEPENDENCE with the HOWs and WHATs of an existence that is driven by WHY.</p>
