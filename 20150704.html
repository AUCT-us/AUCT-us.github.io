<p>People get completely sidetracked by WHAT they have, WHAT they have done ... they ask "What should I do? What can I do? What is the best thing to do?"</p>

<p>It is not about WHAT.  What is an artifact of HOW.</p>

<p>So a lot of people imagine that are ahead of the curve because they understand that HOW matters ... but also get it wrong, because they are completely mesmerized with the HOW of it.  And the problem is that HOW does not matter.</p>

<p>It is all about WHY.  Without a WHY, HOW and WHAT do not matter.  What is an artifact of HOW and HOW is an artifact of WHY.</p>
<pre><code>It is very important to get the WHY right.</code></pre>

<p>Very few people really think about WHY they do something. WHY is a very, very, very, very, very HARD question to answer.</p>

<p>But without WHY, we have no legitimate focus -- we are just shooting in the general direction of what might be the target.</p>

<p>In Theory of Constraints parlances, all that matters is THE GOAL. We can get lost in How we are going to do something or What we are doing [to justify our salary], but none of that matters unless we have a HOW and a WHAT that serve our WHY!</p>

<p>WHAT and HOW without WHY are pure, unadulterated waste.</p>
