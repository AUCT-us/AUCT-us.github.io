THE reason that I am interested in open source is flexibility and extensibility [to a degree] but mostly my interest is about MAINTAINABILITY.  

Maintainability does not just spontaneously happen.  Much, maybe even most, of the Javascript code hacked together by *developers* worldwide is pretty much unmaintainable ***junk.js*** ... it might *just work* but maintenance of the code tends to be a matter of the original developer(s) *keeping their heads in the game* and staying engaged to remember how the thing was supposed to work and where the technical debt *anti-treasure* or where the treasure troves of dangerous anti-patterns and bad [unintentional] easter eggs are buried ... in other words, unmaintable code might expediently *get the job done*, but it cannot serve as a foundation, it cannot be built upon.

Maintainability is important because maintainability means thinking about the capabilities of OTHER people and maintaining their ability to be independent and free to protect themselves and advance their cause [without hurting other people]. Taking away the independence of others is one of the most immoral things that anyone can do.  Open source code and data are part of this -- so are distributed information, defense and security. 

*"There is much more to be hoped for in an excess of information or of weapons than in the restriction of information or arms control."* â€” Jean Baudrillard ... from the ***epigraph*** of Cody Wilson's book [Come and Take It: The Gun Printer's Guide to Thinking Free](https://www.amazon.com/Come-Take-Printers-Guide-Thinking-ebook/dp/B01CO34MBI/)
