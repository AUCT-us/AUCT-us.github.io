THE reason that I am interested in open source is flexibility and extensibility [to a degree] but mostly my interest is about MAINTAINABILITY.  

Maintainability does not just spontaneously happen.  Not all that long ago, **it used to be** [and in some cases still is] true that much, if not most, of the Javascript code hacked together by *developers* worldwide is pretty much unmaintainable ***junk.js*** ... this is not a critique of Javascript or ECMAscript language itself; it is a critique of the sloppy practices that are possible.  Javascript [and simply trusting the Javascript of others or enabling Javascript in the *sandbox* represented the web browser] makes lots of crappy, error-prone, spammy and even downright malevolent code possible ... but the *beauty* [and its potential for sheer evil] of Javascript lies in the combination of ubiquity and expedience.  

Now, it might *just work* but maintenance of the code tends to be a matter of the original developer(s) *keeping their heads in the game* and staying engaged to remember how the thing was supposed to work and where the technical debt *anti-treasure* or where the treasure troves of dangerous anti-patterns and [intentionally-bad] virus-enabling *easter eggs* are buried ... in other words, unmaintainable code might expediently *get the job done*, but it cannot serve as a foundation.  It definitely should not be something that is built upon, replicated, cloned, widely-distributed ... ESPECIALLY when the code includes *easter eggs* exploitable weaknesses.

Fortunately the strength of the open source ecosystem is producing antidotes to bad Javascript ... elements in the community have recognized Javascript's weaknesses and better practices are being strongly encouraged.  [Awesome transpilers, linters, build tools, pattern repositories for Javascript](https://github.com/sorrycc/awesome-javascript) are constantly being developed and improved ... but there's still no substitute for constantly thinking about maintainability ... there's no substitute for being skeptical of the *MAGIC* of the *candy* that is distributed based on an intensely widely-used language like Javascript.

Maintainability is important because maintainability means thinking about the capabilities of OTHER people and maintaining their ability to be independent and free to protect themselves and advance their cause [without hurting other people]. Taking away the independence of others is one of the most immoral things that anyone can do.  Open source code and data are part of this -- so are distributed information, defense and security.

*"There is much more to be hoped for in an excess of information or of weapons than in the restriction of information or arms control."* â€” Jean Baudrillard ... from the ***epigraph*** of Cody Wilson's book [Come and Take It: The Gun Printer's Guide to Thinking Free](https://www.amazon.com/Come-Take-Printers-Guide-Thinking-ebook/dp/B01CO34MBI/)
