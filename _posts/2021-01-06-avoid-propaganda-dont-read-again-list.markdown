In order to have time to do important things ... you must refrain from doing STUPID things ... for example, you should generally avoid drugs and alcohol ... perhaps a cup of coffee in the morning and perhaps a drink with dinner are not going to cost you ... but if you use drugs/alchol to excess OR to deal with stress, you will greatly reduce the time that you have to THINK or to do the important things that you should do with your life. Hopefully, the point of your life is NOT about swallowing your way to a comfortable bliss ... but **some people are defined by their swallowing.**

You definitely should never swallow anything from a news organization ... if you need to swallow something every day, you should realize that you have a problem and are powerless over your addiction ... until you stop swallowing.

There are ONLY 86,400 seconds/day ... you're probably not going to live past 125 or so ... you have a very finite stock of time to use optimally each day ... you simply do not have ANY time to waste on anything coming from a news organization, ie it's ALL hate-spawning us-vs-them propaganda from the last-to-know, behind-the-curve, PR regurgitator journous and their editors ... you also should know better than to watch something as ineffiecient as delivering ideas as a video ... finally, it's ok to take-the-pulse of friends/family or to see-where-their-heads-are-at on social media, but don't waste time trying to be liked.

# Propaganda

The only valid, sustainable response anything coming from a news organization is to IGNORE the shitstorm ... not just the NY Times or Drudge or Brietbart or Townhall ...  but ignore every last ORGANIZED purveyor of schlock ... avoid the entire climate and atmosphere producing all shitstorms and responses to shitstorms ... from ALL news organizations and ALL political journos ... **you ain't gonna need any of it.**

*If you are still operating in that field ... re-trace your steps somehow and exit the landmine NOW ... stop participating and lending ANY credence whatsover to the profession.*

If it were not clear enough before, we are in the middle of an information nuclear war or thermonuclear meltdown ... ALL news reporting by ALL news organizations is fully weaponized and devoid of any legitimate content, execpt in the meta-sense, eg serving as an indication of the depravity of the journo or news organization dishing up the radioactive poison.  

If you are still operating in that field ... re-trace your steps somehow and exit the landmine NOW ... stop participating and lending ANY credence whatsover to the profession.

## ICYMI ... the "reporting" by ANYONE on January 6th was obviously NOT reporting any more

*The sign at Sodom and Gomorrah said "Do NOT look back."

If it were not obvious enough before, the BLATANT propagandization of the main stream media continues to break into brand new areas of complete disgustingness ... if there was any doubt that new depths could be plumbed, consider the reportage on January 6th ... the best response is to just turn ALL of it off and leave it off. 

There's one example on one exemplary day that proves the point ... on January 6th, the New York Times claimed, BASED ON UNNAMED SOURCES, that UNKNOWN parties MIGHT HAVE embedded malware in JetBrains software which might have made the [SolarWinds hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach) and other widespread security compromises more possible.

One has to wonder HOW is this even news to NY Times readers? Are NY Times readers that clueless about development IDEs and the introduction of security issues into code -- that lack of infosec literacy itself would be concerning. If there's any merit [for the clueless] to the story whatsoever, something like this not news to information security professionals ... HINT: Except for idiots [who shouold not be employed and earning salaries], nobody *really* trusts their dev toolchain or devices. Moreover, professionals build checks into their processes and then, several others, do othogonal independent checks on the checks that people have put in place. Why was it necessary for the NYTimes editors to dish up this hysterical radioactive waste with other unfounded assertions on January 6th? Of course, we all KNOW what the answer is ... as a result...

*Anything produced by a news organization is at the top of our* ***Do NOT Waste Your Time Reading This SHIT*** *list.*
