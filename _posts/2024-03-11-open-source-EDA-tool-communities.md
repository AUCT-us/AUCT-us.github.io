Let's say that you wanted to become some sort of [hardware verification engineer for company like NVIDIA](https://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/NVIDIAExternalCareerSite?q=hardware%20verification&jobFamilyGroup=0c40f6bd1d8f10ae43ffaefd46dc7e78) ... you will have to go a little bit *beyond just being able to regurgitate Wikipedia pages for terms such as* [system-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_synthesis) [RTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register-transfer_level), [SystemVerilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemVerilog), [Universal Verification Methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Verification_Methodology), [Synopsys VCS](https://www.synopsys.com/verification/simulation/vcs.html) or equivalent [HDL simulation tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HDL_simulators) like [MentorGraphics ModelSim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModelSim), [Debussy debug tool](https://www.design-reuse.com/news/1659/novas-open-source-web-tool.html), [the GNU Debugger](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/gdb-debug) for [debugging during hardware verification](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gdb-for-firmware-1).

You kind of need to understand the how/why/what of electronic design automation (EDA) toolchains, including just enough of the history to be dangerous, ie to be able to understand the context of the tools that you will be using. As metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology progressed, millions and then billions of MOS transistors could be placed on one chip -- which means, that well before, [we entered the billion-transistor processor era over 20 years ago](https://web.archive.org/web/20110608072423/http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-products/processors/4079511/Intel-enters-billion-transistor-processor-era), integrated circuit designs really ***required*** the kind of exhaustively thorough planning and simulation tasks that would be impossible without modern EDA toolchains.

Now ... let's say ... just for the sake of arguement that you were interested in help people get up to speed with open source EDA tools ... knowing full well, that maximizing productivity from the best of the best designers will warrant the top-of-the-line proprietary EDA tools ... but also knowing that the open source EDA tools are ***good enough*** for DEVELOPING A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF ALMOST ALL OF THE WORK that will needs to be done.

It's probably a good idea to BEGIN our discussion of the open source development communities that surround different open source EDA tools with [a ***very-high level*** **introduction** to the basic EDA design flow](https://anysilicon.com/asic-design-flow-ultimate-guide/) that is typically used for [Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Scale_Integration), [Very High Speed Integrated Circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_High_Speed_Integrated_Circuit_Program), [Ultra Large-Scale Integrated Circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit#ULSI,_WSI,_SoC_and_3D-IC), [Wafer-Scale Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wafer-scale_integration), [System on a Chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip), [3D Integrated Circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_integrated_circuit), [Multi-chip Modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-chip_module), [Flip Chip Multi-Chip Modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_chip) and an increasing variety of hardware ... especially for anyone who has not had much experience in the realm of using an [EDA design flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_flow_(EDA)) for producing any kind of [integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) such as microprocessors (CPUs), graphical processors (GPUs), tensor processors (TPUs), AI accelerators, ASICs, FPGAs and the vast array of other large combinations of integrated circuits.
