Financial technology, or the technology of full, complete, quality-assured transactions is one of my [philanthropic venture](http://markbruns.github.io/philanthropy/mvp/opensource/2017/07/15/Venture-Philanthropy.html) areas ... I am not especially interested in the dark voodoo world untraceable cryptocurrency ... in fact, I think that much of the desire for products in that realm will never really be realized, except as elaborate traps to sucker criminals and those who wish to evade the law ... I also am not convinced that cryptocurrencies will ever really replace the financial traffic handled by the likes of Visa, Mastercard, American Express and PayPal ... if cryptocurrencies replace these dominant and entrenched mediums of exchange, it will be because cryptocurrencies offer something that is more convenient or somehow offers more utlity than simply paying with a credit card. In other words, credit cards will not be replaced because they are not hip or trendy -- they will be replaced when something more convenient comes along ... in the same way that credit/debit cards replaced paying for things with either wads of cash or checks -- it was not because the cool kids were using credit cards.

Blockchain represents a opportunity to do more to capture more information and assure the quality of a transaction ... it's not about anonymity, it's about everybody involved being assured that EVERYTHING about the transaction is *on the up and up* while also assuring that people who are not involved in the transaction do not readily have access to specific details about detailed information of the transaction that are none of their business.
