*And then it hit me ... first, I realized that do not understand my own LinkedIn profile For RETIREMENT ... and then, it really hit me that it's not just retirement ... I realized that I had been approaching job search COMPLETELY WRONG for my entire career, but what REALLY floored me is that general approach thoughout industry, throughout our education system, thoroughout our entire economy is* ***completely wrong and BACKWARD.***

We should be SERVING FIRST ... and thinking about how we can indefinitely sustain our ability to serve first.

We have all always kind of known that we need to try to make ourselves so useful that we are indispensable to others.

That's a given -- it's the essence of what we attempt to do with education, with our careers, with our businesses, with our lives.  

But, we've been doing it all BACKWARDS ... because we need to FIRST, before serving others, be able to INDEFINITELY sustain our ability to be able to serve first.

The PRE-REQUISITE and CONTINUING REQUIREMENT of all of our efforts to SERVE FIRST is that we must set SMART goals and work toward personal excellence to have the foundation of NEVER WORRYING, NEVER BEING NEEDY ... and then to work at our health and productivity to always be strong, capable and anxious to be called upon to serve ... and more than that, we must realize that MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO ASK US FOR HELP are simply not worthy of being helping ... because they will choose to worry, they will choose to be needy, they will choose to blame others for not doing what they PATHETICALLY ask.  


Our personal brand to SERVE FIRST has to be an HONEST and GENUINE reflection of our personal struggle toward excellence ... and we must expect those who ask for our help will work themselves in their own personal struggle toward excellence ***AND we need to leave the dead and those who have chosen to be dead to bury their dead.***


We do that best by articulating a vision, defining an agenda and developing a personal brand ... building that brand with our own productivity, our our own skills, our own ideas about improving the health of our lives ... our own personal brand is about being healthier, being more fit, being more able to defend ourselves, being more able to help others be more fit, healthier, more productive ... but ultimately it is about the Name-Image-Likeness (NIL) asset -- because we must PUBLICLY reach out to other people around the world to FIND the community of people who share our interests, who might have similar general health and fitness goals, who also aspire to be healthier ... ***AND we need to leave the dead to bury their dead.***

# 16-week syllabus for studying how manage name-image-likeness digital assets and endorsement deals associated with a personal brand



### Important Considerations:

***The name-image-likeness asset that we will build has to match the personal struggle toward excellence.***  One area that you must establish an excellent personal compentence in your ability to gather intelligence and consider your options given your own personal values and goals.

Gathering intelligence and being situationally aware of the ENTIRE world around you will PRE-REQUISITE and CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENT.  Obviously yesterday's information or situational awareness is flawed for two reasons: 1) It was not perfect to begin with; it reflected your cognitive biases; 2) It's already dated; you cannot base your life on your musings from looking in the rear view mirror, even though most people do. The world around you will continue to adjust and change, so me must constantly re-adjust/revise our SMART goals and work toward personal excellence.

Remember that this is a rapidly evolving landscape ... it's impossible to be current enough.  The NIL space and everything we touch through our work in this space is especially rapidly changing. Stay updated on new developments! It's more essential to stay CURRENT in these matters than it is to stay current on your real estate, stocks or investment portfolio.

You will NEED develop ways of staying current with applicable laws and regulations. Do not expect your attorney to be current; NIL assets are YOUR assets, not your attorney's assets -- so your attorney can only ADVISE you inside his narrow range of expertise and most established attorneys have little or now background in these areas.  You will need to develop multiple sources of legal advice to give you second, third, fourth and fifth opinions.  Based on your knowledge of this realm, it is up to YOU to hire competent counsel. It is up to YOU interview, hire and constantly find new legal advice. NIL rules vary by state. It is up to YOU to adapt this syllabus based on your local regulations.
