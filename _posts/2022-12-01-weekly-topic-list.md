We mostly read as a break from work ... but we try to speedread *with serious, critical intention.* 

# Topic Lists

Our aim with this listing is to never have to think about our next list of items to read/annotate ... we want to have at least 125 good topic ideas in the hopper, to have 25 that we work on at least once a month, to have five that we touch once a week and to have ONE main one that we are focusing on getting right.

2) Atomic layer deposition, atomic layer etching, atomic layer epitaxy

3) Semiconductor manufacturing, semiconductor physics, semiconductor devices

4) Flowering plants, particularly trees, woody plants, shrubs, vines

20) [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html) is NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for high-performance machine learning research. What’s new is that JAX uses [XLA(the Accelerated Linear Algebra compiler)](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla) to compile and run your NumPy code on accelerators, like GPUs and TPUs.

21) [WasmEdge](https://wasmedge.org/docs/) and [TinyLlama](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama) ... including the use of [crun](https://github.com/containers/crun), [youki](https://github.com/containers/youki), [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/), [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/) and similar approaches to achieve faster, more secure, smaller footprint, lower-memory requirement [OCI Runtime](https://opencontainers.org/posts/blog/2023-07-21-oci-runtime-spec-v1-1/) containerized resources for edge computing.

22) [The last week or so's worth of Arxiv pre-print abstracts in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-term=cs.LG&terms-0-field=all&terms-1-operator=AND&terms-1-term=&terms-1-field=title&classification-physics_archives=all&classification-include_cross_list=include&date-filter_by=past_12&date-year=&date-from_date=&date-to_date=&date-date_type=submitted_date&abstracts=show&size=200&order=-announced_date_first) ... the current rate of new papers is about 42,000 per year or 800 per week.

23) [Methods of information geometry](https://www.ams.org/books/mmono/191/mmono191-endmatter.pdf) including things lie the [Fisher information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information) carried in an observable random variable about an unknown parameter and how the [Cramér–Rao bound(CRB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound) or the [Hammersley-Chapman–Robbins lower bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapman%E2%80%93Robbins_bound) used to bound the variance of biased estimators of a given biased.

24) [The last week or so's worth of Arxiv preprint abstracts on Condensed Matter Physics](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-term=phase+transitions&terms-0-field=title&classification-physics=y&classification-physics_archives=cond-mat&classification-include_cross_list=include&date-filter_by=past_12&date-year=&date-from_date=&date-to_date=&date-date_type=submitted_date&abstracts=show&size=200&order=-announced_date_first) with an emphasis on [phase transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition) and a particular emphasis on [geometric frustration](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-term=geometrical+frustration&terms-0-field=title&classification-physics=y&classification-physics_archives=cond-mat&classification-include_cross_list=include&date-filter_by=all_dates&date-year=&date-from_date=&date-to_date=&date-date_type=submitted_date&abstracts=show&size=200&order=-announced_date_first)

25) The [pattern of frustration formation in the functional brain network](https://direct.mit.edu/netn/article/6/4/1334/112207/Pattern-of-frustration-formation-in-the-functional) and our [requirement to change of functional brain network across the lifespan](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34793536/) and the [dynamics of the process of cognitive dissonance removal](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/40acbf791850dc0fc1a2ff04670ef86e20ee95a8/Lifetime-of-links-influences-the-evolution-towards-structural-balance/graph), ie "How can we learn faster?".

26) Develop an "end-of-motherboard" design tool architecture for going beyond simply [integrating GPU & memory semiconductors into a single package](https://wccftech-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/wccftech.com/sk-hynix-plans-on-integrating-gpu-memory-semiconductors-into-a-single-package-defying-industry-trends/amp/) which would involve looking at [how GPUs are made](https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/how-gpus-are-made-1000923) including an iterative design process which would include cycling through several layers which might be something like: 1) high level design, 2) floorplan and netlist, 3) circuit verification and emulation, 4) mask making, 5) photolithography, 6) several different processes to deposit and etch which produces the patterned oxide layers for the foundation, 7) several different chemical and plasma vapor deposition sub-processes to create the n-channel MOSFETs, p-channel MOSFETs and any other transistor-like components, 8) connecting everything in several sub-processes of deposition, etching, electoplating and chemical-mechanical polishing 9) design for testing including optical image recognition for proper registration to complete wafer probing as well as he potential for minor rework for yield improvement, 10) packaging and thermal optimization

27) [Generic Mapping Tools(GMT)](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/)

28) [Alliance/Coriolis](https://github.com/lip6/coriolis) vs the [universe of alternatives](https://www.engineersgarage.com/top-eda-tools-vlsi-design/) for producing/documenting a SoC high level design product requirement specification

29) Key benefits of advanced nuclear reactors ... I'm not convinced that [advanced small modular nukes](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/4-key-benefits-advanced-small-modular-reactors) are a good thing; economies of scale are a very huge and real thing in power generation ... decentralized power generation is not good just because people are too excited about decentralized things ... sometimes, as with power generation in particular, centralization is a VERY VERY positive attribute.
