# Reading is a lifelong JOURNEY.

We mostly read as a break from work or to changeup the workday ... as we go along, we try to speedread and improve our ability read better *with serious, critical intention* and using all the tools at our disposal, such as AI listification -- the point of reading is to gather intelligence about the road ahead. 

We can stress enough that [**using AI tools, curating and annotating reading and the disicplined upgrading of the whole reading skillstack is in itself a lifelong JOURNEY**](https://markbruns.github.io/Listify/) ... but the whole point of reading and listification is about leadership and not just better understanding the road ahead, but working at getting better at reading.

There's a reason why readers become better leaders when they understand why and how leaderships is about intelligence gathering and skills in reading or gathering the necessary background for future situations.

# Topic Lists [otherwise known as *rabbitholes*]

READING / curating / annotating listings of topics is a lifelong JOURNEY in intelligence gathering and exploration ... there are a lot of  rabbitholes to explore, but one almost always finds that exploring one rabbithole informs the journey or gives things from other rabbitholes some coherency ... this reading JOURNEY is not a substitute for actually DOING things; instead it's about the preparation for maximizing the productivity in doing things and not just doing things for the sake of keeping busy or appearing to have done something.

READING is about gathering intell to working much smarter on a precise target ... rather than just blowing shit up and causing a lot of collateral damage by doing stuff or driving around and gawking.

Our aim with this listing is to have a GOTO lists for any downtime, to never have to think about our next list of items to read/annotate ... we want to have at least 125 good topic ideas in the hopper ... we might to have 25 or so [VENTURES](https://markbruns.github.io/Ventures/) which we work on at least once a month ... to have five key projects that we touch once a week ... and to have ONE main one that is operational now ... and that we are focusing on getting right.

15) TRIZ, ARIZ, technical knowledge-graph problem-solving, invention suggestions based on corpus of patents ... for example, consider DRAIN.tips for with the types of techniquess and tools used by a professional to unclog a clogged sewer drain ... the beauty of AI models is that you can keep asking DETAILED questions, ie the model does not get irritated with all of the questions and demand payment for a service call ... you can START by [diligently asking at least five levels of questions of something like Llama2-70] ... the first answer is not going to be enough; many AI answers will be rather useless, eg try some baking soda, then call a plumber ... even questions about what a plumber does will be extremely vague and worthless ... for instance, a plumber typically uses a variety of specialized tools and equipment to unclog a clogged sewer drain; this is rather obvious, but it is necessary to drill down a few questions further to get to *the point where one can be mildly dangerous*. Some of the most common tools and equipment used by plumbers for the drain unclogging purpose include:

* Drain cleaning or tree root killing compounds: Drain cleaning chemicals are used to dissolve and break up clogs, but tree root killing compounds are herbicides that will not kill most trees, but will kill roots that have penetrated the sewer lines. These compounds are poured down the drain and allowed to sit for a period of time, days not just hours, before being rinsed away with water jets ... in other words, these compunds are not really the solution, they are the preparation for making other measures possible. 

* Drain snake: A drain snake is a long, flexible rod that is mostly used to quickly explore -- a drain snake will not be sufficient to remove tougher clogs from sewer drains, so many plumbers will not even bother with a snake. The snake is inserted into the drain and manipulated to navigate the twists and turns of the pipe, allowing the plumber to reach and possibly remove the clog, but more likely, the snake will only bring back some evidence of what kind of problem is causing the clog.

* Drain auger or roto-rooter: A drain auger is a long, flexible rod with a spiral end that is designed to break up and remove clogs. The auger is inserted into the drain and turned clockwise to feed the cable into the pipe, and then counterclockwise to remove any blockages. The auger is then pulled out of the drain, bringing the clog with it ... of course, these augers are really tough to handle and extremely heavy to carry into place, so they are not really the first solution ... unless the plumber has bought a new rotorooter and needs to pay the sonofabitch off.  

* Hydro-jetter: A hydro-jetter is a high-pressure water jet that is used to clear out clogs and buildup from sewer drains. The hydro-jetter uses a combination of pressure and heat in a water jet, usually a high pressure water using a source of extremely hot water from the water heater and a variet of specialized nozzles to break up and remove clogs. The world of sewer jetting fittings is almost large enough to be its own industry ... highly specialized sewer jetting equipment is used by masters of this trade, like DrainAddict, to clear out clogs and buildup from sewer drains. Typically, the higher end of this set up involves a trailer with its own generator specialized mobile  high-pressure water jetting pumps along with higher-end optical sewer cams and other inspection aides.

* Camera inspection equipment: A camera inspection is often used to visually inspect the inside of the sewer drain to determine the location and severity of the clog ... but it is necessary to have to drain somewhat unclogged or charged with clear water or else the inspection line cannot even see what it is causing the clog. The camera is inserted into the drain and provides a live video feed to the plumber, allowing them to assess the situation and determine the best course of action.

* Pipe bursting equipment is used for really serious clogs ... bursting equipment is used to replace damaged or clogged sewer pipes. The equipment uses a specialized cable to burst the damaged pipe and replace it with a new one ... obviously, this is a last resort and not something that is done lightly, but it is less expensive than digging up the yard and replacing the pipe.

* Trenchless technology: Trenchless technology such as Insituform is used to repair or replace sewer pipes without digging trenches. The technology uses a specialized camera and equipment to navigate the pipes and repair or replace damaged sections.

35) How should anyone go about the process of trying stay fit? It's primarily a MENTAL exercise augmented with AI for the tedious processes of keeping up with the literature ... but, realistically, it has to be much more practical, much more immediate and an exercise in serious moment-by-moment mindfulness which inevitably involves a physical exercise component and as well as a nutritional component. 

36) How can one optimize one's Github engagement? ... beyond just commitgraph ... actions for build/review/test during dev ... copilot ... discussions ... issues-driven CI/CD ... better commit messages and Git discipline... become the best Github advertisement for everything Github

37) Remote work, asynch.work, ENGR.co client services, API data access connection, manipulators, system integration, project management, verification/validation ... get your assets ready ... attracting and outreach is huge part of it, but you need to think with the end in mind, ie how do you close deals and monetize?

75) The architecture of the [IoT data model in Omniverse](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/iot-samples), allowing for a data driven approach and separation of concerns that is ***similar to*** [but not exactly equivalent to] a [Model/View/Controller (MVC) design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) which could be implemented with an approach that is like [Blazor WASM](https://dev.to/jamattey/what-is-blazor-wasm-4n8) to reuse code components in different environments, ie with Omniverse Nucleus running as a server for an Omniverse Workstation-like environment for everything that Nucleus brings to the table and a much lighter-weight less-connected environment without the Omniverse Nucleus for primarily just looking at the data without connecting to and updating the Nucleus USD database ...  for use cases like optical image capture in maps/geo, medical imaging, computervision/robotics, driverless vehicles, industrial automation, smart cities, smart buildings, smart factories, smart grids, smart homes, smart retail, smart transportation, smart utilities ...the further universe of smart everything, smart wearables, smart agriculture, smart logistics, smart supply chain, smart security, smart surveillance, smart energy, smart water, smart waste management, smart lighting, smart parking, smart street lighting, smart traffic management, smart metering, smart sensors, smart devices, smart appliances, smart locks, smart thermostats, smart doorbells, smart cameras, smart speakers, smart displays, smart TVs, smart refrigerators, smart washing machines, smart dryers, smart dishwashers, smart ovens, smart microwaves, smart vacuums, smart air purifiers, smart air conditioners, smart fans, smart heaters, smart humidifiers, smart dehumidifiers, smart water heaters, smart water purifiers, smart water softeners ...

It's sort of important to understand how MUCH faster the NVLink GPUs will be than any found in a PCIe-based interconnection in a home lab or ML cluster which would typically use by something like an Oculink card. Although, PCIe Gen 5.0 is not too shabby compared to the alternative, because it is double the possible 16 GB/s of multilane PCIe Gen 4.0 ... a multi-lane PCIe throughput would deliver higher than the current 25 GB/s possible transmission rate of the [Oculink, "optical copper link" cable](https://www.howtogeek.com/what-is-oculink/) ... way faster than Thunderbolt 4 which caps out at around 5 GB/s or less ... EXCEPT that Oculink card is only going to use ONE lane, so that optical copper link cable will not be the bottleneck ... but [PCIe 6.0 is coming and I/O bandwidth in even little home lab mini-PCs is going to be a lot faster than it is now](https://www.howtogeek.com/786991/pcie-6.0-whats-new-and-when-can-you-get-it/) ... fueled by money that will be spend for remote work and computing workloads on HEDT systems for machine learning, we will likely see [I/O bandwidth double every three years or so](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/pcie-60-spec-reaches-final-draft-milestone) to spur turnover and upgrading for new HEDT systems, so expect that PCIe 6.0 and then PCIe 7.0 will be available and will be a lot faster than the 128 possible GB/s of PCIe 5.0 ... but, for the foreseeable future, the NVLink interconnects available in edgey cloud compute services is the fastest thing going.

80) Brainstorming the MONETIZATION of bootstrapping of a new venture ... how does the bootstrapped venture pay for itself: #1 ideas are free; use the free stuff first -- anything that you add to a URL or location on the internet has to generate revenue  ... but an accelerated negotiation requires gathering a crowd of interested parties -- so build that crowd, build word-of-mouth or linksharing but generating crowdliness is about leading the rabble to become a quasi-coherent crowd and listening to the crowd, really *using* the crowd to fund things that improve life for the crowd and generally make the crowd better for members of the crowd  ... so it's ideas, ideas, ideas -- but mostly the ideas have to come from the crowd ... the better quality new ideas and refinement of ideas will come as you are grinding on execution of ideas ... diligently put into action even though they appear to be unsuccessful, ie most of the value is in what lessons you are learning ... keep your costs low and then lower them more ... it's going to be tougher than you think, so be prepare yourself for grinding on the grind ... eventually set up an auction and sell out, but retain ownership and continue to be part of the idea or hold it hostage until someone pays you to go away ... the point is to BE the grinder, the kind of leader who leads from the front 

81) Startupcook ... MVP and Lean Enterprise ... stick with that minimum and polish it ... build the braintrust from the EARS and EYES ... gather information; then improve the gathering of information ... process the information into knowledge and share that knowledge in order to build the braintrust ... the braintrust is the most valuable thing ... the braintrust is the thing that is monetized ... the braintrust is the thing that is sold ... the braintrust is the thing that is the product ... the braintrust is the thing that is the service ... the braintrust is the thing that adds and polishes the value ... the braintrust is the thing that defines the value proposition ... the braintrust is the thing that directs the monetization in a way that adds the most value to the participants of the crowd supporting the lean enterprise -- but in the end, all value created has to be invested in better intelligence gathering, information processing and knowledge sharing ... ultimately, the cashout plan is about putting together a CSOP, a customer-driven stock ownership plan ... the investors have to be evangelists for the crowd ... we asked the [Llama 2 70B playground to furnish ideas for monetizing a startup](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/llama2-70b) ... we then followed up with a question "What are ten different ways learn about X" ... we keep following up with questions and our own noodling around ... it's daunting, but fishing's all about getting your *lines in the water and* ***watching your bobber***, then refining the approach to putting something into practice and then polishing the things that work and polishing more, while continuing to put new lines in the water ... it's daunting ... in other words, while these ideas that AI model like Llama can give you are not exactly bad -- they're just trite and easy ... each one needs the kind of further HARD clarification and expansion that only can come from lean implementation, ie *doing it smart, but using the* ***extra cheap*** *ways and free stuff first.* 

* Identify your target audience and their needs, then create a product or service that addresses those needs.
    
    * Conduct market research: Conducting market research can help you identify your target audience and their needs. This can include surveys, focus groups, and interviews with potential customers.

    * Define your subscription offerings: Determine what products or services you want to offer through your subscription model. Consider what your target audience needs and how you can provide value to them. You can offer different tiers of subscriptions with varying levels of benefits to cater to different segments of your audience.
    * Set pricing strategies: Pricing is a crucial aspect of your subscription model. You need to set prices that are competitive, affordable, and profitable. Consider offering discounts for long-term commitments or bundling products and services to create a more attractive offer.
    * Develop a marketing strategy: Create a marketing strategy that targets your identified audience and promotes your subscription model. Utilize social media, email marketing, and content marketing to reach your audience and drive sign-ups.
    * Offer a free trial: Offering a free trial is an effective way to encourage people to sign up for your subscription model. It allows them to experience your product or service risk-free and see the value it provides.
    * Leverage customer feedback: Encourage customer feedback to improve your subscription model continuously. Collect feedback through surveys, focus groups, and customer support interactions. Use this feedback to refine your offerings and improve customer satisfaction.
    * Monitor and analyze performance: Keep track of your subscription model's performance using analytics tools. Monitor metrics such as customer acquisition costs, churn rates, and lifetime value to identify areas for improvement
