# Reading is a lifelong JOURNEY.

We mostly read as a break from work or to changeup the workday ... as we go along, we try to speedread and improve our ability read better *with serious, critical intention* and using all the tools at our disposal, such as AI listification -- the point of reading is to gather intelligence about the road ahead. 

We can stress enough that [**using AI tools, curating and annotating reading and the disicplined upgrading of the whole reading skillstack is in itself a lifelong JOURNEY**](https://markbruns.github.io/Listify/) ... but the whole point of reading and listification is about leadership and not just better understanding the road ahead, but working at getting better at reading.

There's a reason why readers become better leaders when they understand why and how leaderships is about intelligence gathering and skills in reading or gathering the necessary background for future situations.

# Topic Lists [otherwise known as *rabbitholes*]

READING / curating / annotating listings of topics is a lifelong JOURNEY in intelligence gathering and exploration ... there are a lot of  rabbitholes to explore, but one almost always finds that exploring one rabbithole informs the journey or gives things from other rabbitholes some coherency ... this reading JOURNEY is not a substitute for actually DOING things; instead it's about the preparation for maximizing the productivity in doing things and not just doing things for the sake of keeping busy or appearing to have done something.

READING is about gathering intell to working much smarter on a precise target ... rather than just blowing shit up and causing a lot of collateral damage by doing stuff or driving around and gawking.

Our aim with this listing is to have a GOTO lists for any downtime, to never have to think about our next list of items to read/annotate ... we want to have at least 125 good topic ideas in the hopper ... we might to have 25 or so [VENTURES](https://markbruns.github.io/Ventures/) which we work on at least once a month ... to have five key projects that we touch once a week ... and to have ONE main one that is operational now ... and that we are focusing on getting right.

It's primarily a MENTAL exercise augmented with AI for the tedious processes of keeping up with the literature ... but, realistically, it has to be much more practical, much more immediate and an exercise in serious moment-by-moment mindfulness which inevitably involves a physical exercise component and as well as a nutritional component. 

36) How can one optimize one's Github engagement? ... beyond just commitgraph ... actions for build/review/test during dev ... copilot ... discussions ... issues-driven CI/CD ... better commit messages and Git discipline... become the best Github advertisement for everything Github

37) Remote work, asynch.work, ENGR.co client services, API data access connection, manipulators, system integration, project management, verification/validation ... get your assets ready ... attracting and outreach is huge part of it, but you need to think with the end in mind, ie how do you close deals and monetize?

38) Universal Scene Description, [Blender 4.0 with Omniverse Connect](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/connect/latest/blender/release-notes.html#usd-201-1), [Revit with Omniverse Connect](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/connect/latest/revit.html) or maybe even [Autodesk Architecture, Engineering and Construction Collection](https://www.autodesk.com/collections/architecture-engineering-construction/overview?term=1&tab=subscription&plc=AECCOL) ...

77) [Open Microscopy Environment(OME)](https://github.com/ome/openmicroscopy) and [OME Remote Objects (OMERO)](https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/index.html) including how [Bio-Formats library for reading and writing life science image file formats](https://bio-formats.readthedocs.io/en/v7.0.1/about/index.html) processes metadata, and provides other useful information such as version history and how to report bugs and annotate files ... as we can see by looking through the [Eliceiri Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation](https://loci.wisc.edu/) [materials on Github](https://github.com/uw-loci), open microscopy is really about deeping the commitment to open source and open access in science and moving beyond just open access and open results toward a *almost radically* [much more open, continual, long-term process](https://uw-loci.github.io/oss) of collaborative exploration in the virtual laboratory ... achieving scientific interoperability is like software interoperability, in that it depends upon the adoption, reuse and (as best practices and de facto standards emerge) the exacting definition of [software] standards to obtains those [benefits we associate with standard in all things](https://www.din.de/en/about-standards) to promote greater efficiency, more correct levels of trust and knowledge for much higher levels of real safety [as opposed to the false promise of regulatory safety].

78) [Algebraic Multigrid Solver (AmgX) Library](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AMGX) ... [computational fluid dynamics](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/amgx-multi-grid-accelerated-linear-solvers-industrial-applications/) for thermochemical decomposition of anisotropic materials by AdvancedPyrolytics ... [OpenFOAM open source OpenCFD](https://www.openfoam.com/) ... [OpenFOAM on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/openfoam) ... [OpenFOAM issues](https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam/-/issues)

79) [GH200 server nodes are connected with an NVLink passive copper cable cartridge](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/one-giant-superchip-for-llms-recommenders-and-gnns-introducing-nvidia-gh200-nvl32/) to enable each Hopper GPU to access the memory of any other Grace Hopper Superchip in the network, providing 32 x 624 GB, or 19.5 TB of NVLink addressable memory  ... the CPU to GPU memory interconnect for NVLink is now 900 GB/s, which is [at least 7x faster than 32 GT/s PCIe Gen 5 that will be used by something like Oculink](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-pcie-gen-50-how-affect-oculink-cables-skyward-telecom/) which is double the possible 16 GT/s of PCIe Gen 4.0 and much higher than the current 25 GB/s possible transmission rate of the [Oculink, "optical copper link] cable](https://www.howtogeek.com/what-is-oculink/) ... way faster than Thunderbolt 4 which caps out at around 5 GB/s
