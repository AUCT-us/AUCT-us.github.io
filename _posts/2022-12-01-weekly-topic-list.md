We mostly read as a break from work ... but we try to speedread *with serious, critical intention.* 

# Topic Lists

READING / curating / annotating listings of topics is a lifelong JOURNEY in intelligence gathering and exploration ... this reading JOURNEY is not a substitute for actually DOING things; instead it's about the preparation for maximizing the productivity in doing things and not just doing things for the sake of keeping busy or appearing to have done something.

READING is about gathering intell to working much smarter on a precise target ... rather than just blowing shit up and causing a lot of collateral damage by doing stuff or driving around and gawking.

Our aim with this listing is to have a GOTO lists for any downtime, to never have to think about our next list of items to read/annotate ... we want to have at least 125 good topic ideas in the hopper ... we might to have 25 or so [VENTURES](https://markbruns.github.io/Ventures/) which we work on at least once a month ... to have five key projects that we touch once a week ... and to have ONE main one that is operational now ... and that we are focusing on getting right.

18) Our hero builds, uses and refines [his new AI applications which are built with AI](https://partyrock.aws/u/MarkBruns/IKKJt96W8/Daily-Wellness-Guide)

19) Future HEDT sandbox configuration: [directly integrated HBM4 GPU memory](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/sk-hynix-plans-to-stack-hbm4-directly-on-logic-processors), [double data rate synchronoous dynamic random-access memory (DDR SDRAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM) and the [JEDEC memory specifications](https://www.jedec.org/category/technology-focus-area/main-memory-ddr3-ddr4-sdram), NVME flash drives for High-Throughput Generative Inference for LLMs with Multiples GPUs ... the [secret sauce is PagedAttention](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html)

20) [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html) is NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for high-performance machine learning research. What’s new is that JAX uses [XLA, the TF Accelerated Linear Algebra compiler](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla) to compile and run your NumPy code on accelerators, like GPUs and TPUs.

21) [WasmEdge](https://wasmedge.org/docs/) and [TinyLlama](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama) ... including the use of [crun](https://github.com/containers/crun), [youki](https://github.com/containers/youki), [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/), [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/) and similar approaches to achieve faster, more secure, smaller footprint, lower-memory requirement [OCI Runtime](https://opencontainers.org/posts/blog/2023-07-21-oci-runtime-spec-v1-1/) containerized resources for edge computing.

22) [The last week or so's worth of Arxiv pre-print abstracts in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-term=cs.LG&terms-0-field=all&terms-1-operator=AND&terms-1-term=&terms-1-field=title&classification-physics_archives=all&classification-include_cross_list=include&date-filter_by=past_12&date-year=&date-from_date=&date-to_date=&date-date_type=submitted_date&abstracts=show&size=200&order=-announced_date_first) ... the current rate of new papers is about 42,000 per year or 800 per week.

23) [Methods of information geometry](https://www.ams.org/books/mmono/191/mmono191-endmatter.pdf) including things lie the [Fisher information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information) carried in an observable random variable about an unknown parameter and how the [Cramér–Rao bound(CRB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound) or the [Hammersley-Chapman–Robbins lower bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapman%E2%80%93Robbins_bound) used to bound the variance of biased estimators of a given biased.

24) [The last week or so's worth of Arxiv preprint abstracts on Condensed Matter Physics](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-term=phase+transitions&terms-0-field=title&classification-physics=y&classification-physics_archives=cond-mat&classification-include_cross_list=include&date-filter_by=past_12&date-year=&date-from_date=&date-to_date=&date-date_type=submitted_date&abstracts=show&size=200&order=-announced_date_first) with an emphasis on [phase transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition) and a particular emphasis on [geometric frustration](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-term=geometrical+frustration&terms-0-field=title&classification-physics=y&classification-physics_archives=cond-mat&classification-include_cross_list=include&date-filter_by=all_dates&date-year=&date-from_date=&date-to_date=&date-date_type=submitted_date&abstracts=show&size=200&order=-announced_date_first)

25) The [pattern of frustration formation in the functional brain network](https://direct.mit.edu/netn/article/6/4/1334/112207/Pattern-of-frustration-formation-in-the-functional) and our [requirement to change of functional brain network across the lifespan](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34793536/) and the [dynamics of the process of cognitive dissonance removal](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/40acbf791850dc0fc1a2ff04670ef86e20ee95a8/Lifetime-of-links-influences-the-evolution-towards-structural-balance/graph), ie "How can we learn faster?".

26) Develop the requirements for an EDA design-for-mfg toolchain architecture for going beyond [design-to-tape-out for 180nm CMOS
integrated circuit fabrication technology](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1908/1908.10674.pdf) or simply [integrating GPU & memory semiconductors into a single package](https://wccftech-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/wccftech.com/sk-hynix-plans-on-integrating-gpu-memory-semiconductors-into-a-single-package-defying-industry-trends/amp/) which would involve looking at [how GPUs might be made better](https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/how-gpus-are-made-1000923) including an iterative design process which would include cycling through several layers which might be something like: 1) high level design, 2) floorplan and netlist, 3) circuit verification and emulation, 4) mask making, 5) photolithography, 6) several different processes to deposit and etch which produces the patterned oxide layers for the foundation, 7) several different chemical and plasma vapor deposition sub-processes to create the n-channel MOSFETs, p-channel MOSFETs and any other transistor-like components, 8) connecting everything in several sub-processes of deposition, etching, electoplating and chemical-mechanical polishing 9) design for testing including optical image recognition for proper registration to complete wafer probing as well as he potential for minor rework for yield improvement, 10) packaging and thermal optimization

27) [Generic Mapping Tools(GMT)](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/)

28) [Alliance/Coriolis](https://github.com/lip6/coriolis),[Electric](https://www.gnu.org/software/electric/), [Glade (Gds, Lef And Def Editor)](https://peardrop.co.uk/) vs the [universe of alternatives](https://www.engineersgarage.com/top-eda-tools-vlsi-design/) for producing/documenting a manufacturable heterogeneous SoC high level design or at least an outline of a product requirement specification ... to be fleshed out with tools like ... [Synopsis Cloud](https://www.synopsys.com/cloud.html), [Cadence Virtuso Heterogeneous Integration](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/custom-ic-analog-rf-design/virtuoso-studio/heterogeneous-integration.html), [Siemens EDA [Mentor Graphics]](https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/), [Silvaco TCAD](https://silvaco.com/tcad/)

29) Key benefits of advanced nuclear reactors ... I try to keep an open mind on these things, but I am not at all convinced that [advanced small modular nukes](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/4-key-benefits-advanced-small-modular-reactors) are strictly a good thing since economies of scale are a very huge, very real and inescapable thermodynamic thing in power generation ... decentralized power generation is not good just because it happens to be a current political fad and people are [temporarily] way too excited about decentralized things ... sometimes, as with power generation in particular, centralization is a VERY VERY positive attribute.

30) [Preevy](https://preevy.dev/) and [Lifecycle](https://docs.livecycle.io/Livecycle%20Overview) ... or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments) or [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/deploy-previews/) or [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/what-is-ngrok/) ... along with something like the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/#architecture) to scrape metrics from instrumented jobs. It's all part of code review, preview and, to some degree, product test environments for observability of containers and CI/CD development workflow

31) [Xilinx design tools](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools.html) ... along with AMD's RadeonOpenCompute  [ROCm open-source stack for graphics processing unit (GPU) computation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/rocm.html) ... and, not just hardware, but also understanding the [ROCm [Software] Developer Tools](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools) especially the lower-level [kernel language [of C++ functions] and conceptual programming model of HIP: C++ Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/reference/kernel_language.html) which is intended to be analogous to the [CUDA® C++ general purpose parallel computing platform and program model](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#cuda-a-general-purpose-parallel-computing-platform-and-programming-model) to exploit [Unified Memory Programming](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#unified-memory-programming) in order to be able to tap the massively parallel nature of GPUs and achieve far higher performance than what is even theoretically possible on an advanced CPU.

32) [JEDEC Committees](https://www.jedec.org/committees) and other means of engaging with professional communities

33) [Keep up with the PyTorch blog](https://pytorch.org/blog/), follow the [best curated PyTorch list](https://github.com/ritchieng/the-incredible-pytorch) and personally [annotate your own PyTorch list](https://github.com/BrunoScience/the-incredible-pytorch)

34) Not just prediction markets for politics ... but risk mgmt and microinsurance ... what's the best probabalistic outcome and how can we eliminate or mitigate the failure modes that threaten achievement of that outcome 

35) How should anyone go about the process of trying stay fit? It's primarily a MENTAL exercise augmented with AI for the tedious processes of keeping up with the literature ... but, realistically, it has to be much more practical, much more immediate and an exercise in serious moment-by-moment mindfulness which inevitably involves a physical exercise component and as well as a nutritional component. 

36) How can one optimize one's Github engagement? ... beyond just commitgraph ... actions for build/review/test during dev ... copilot ... discussions ... issues-driven CI/CD ... better commit messages and Git discipline... become the best Github advertisement for everything Github

37) Remote work, asynch.work, ENGR.co client services, API data access connection, manipulators, system integration, project management, verification/validation ... get your assets ready ... attracting and outreach is huge part of it, but you need to think with the end in mind, ie how do you close deals and monetize?

38) Universal Scene Description, Omniverse, Revit, Canva, Blender ... 

39) Tailscale and VPN workflows, DNS, Bind 

40) LIDAR scan data, using smartphone video to develop digital twins
