**The best way to criticize is to create.**  

It is necessary to avoid creating evil, but you can always recognize evil by its actions; evil terrorizes and oppresses and blames while using all kinds of arguments and pride to justify its use of terror, blame and jealousy.  If you want to defeat an enemy, Sun Tzu’s advice will always hold “first attack the enemy’s strategy, then his alliance, next his army and last his cities.”  

It is tough to think strategically about fighting something as abstract as evil, but you can bring it down to the intensely practical level, where evil has directly impacted your own daily life.  You do not need to look all that far to find the presence of evil.

You might have witnessed the effects of different forms of evil: gossip, subterfuges and office politics, for instance.  You might want to fight the strategies of obfuscators and weasels OR if you detest toxic workplaces and resource-wasting meetings, you have to work on a strategy that involves creating a more just equitable, honest, open workflow.  It's one thing to do that on your own, but establishing something like for others has been really HARD to accomplish on your own ... until now.  

Thanks to the open source revolution, you can join forces with others in playing a small role in creating something like Git or even evangelizing Git in a blog posting.  There's a lot of evil to fight ... but there are TONS of allies ... so if you want to be an Open Source warrior, you need to "march toward the sound of gunfire" or find the most awesome startup companies or heavily-starred, heavily-followed ACTIVE repositories, roll up your sleeves and fork and clone different repositories, learn everything you can about the code, learn about the people involved, blog/tweet/evangelize about what they are up to ... network with different people doing cool things, help do cool things and then network some more!  

If you want to defeat evil, work at creating a PRODUCTIVE community!

**The best way to criticize is to create.  There are opportunities everywhere.  ATTACK! ATTACK!  ATTACK!**
