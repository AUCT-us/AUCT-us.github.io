I am still digesting the depth of what I learned at a recent [Violence Dynamics seminar held in Mounds View, MN](http://chirontraining.com/Site/VioDy_MN_November.html) ... the timetable of the material covered in this seminar is given at the bottom of this posting ... but that doesn't really describe the impact that the seminar had on me.

1) Marc MacYoung is responsible for pointing out that violence is a taboo topic nowadays in the same way that sex was a taboo topic in the 1950s.  You cannot talk about violence in polite company any more.  SEX is a completely different matter. Whether it's stretched, holey spandex on an older overweight woman in Walmart OR the latest overexposure of something that one of the Kardashians should keep private OR a [feminist using her own vaginal yeast for her sourdough bread](http://mashable.com/2015/11/23/blogger-bread-vagina-yeast/#L4U6QKDgpaq3), [whether you want to think about it or not] SEX is something that cannot and will not be underexpressed any more.  The sexual revolution is over and we all have lost.

2) Violence training can disrupt education in the same way that SEX has totally disrupted commerce.  When it comes to team building, trust networks and practical bonds between professionals NOTHING can match hands on training in violence.  When you put others into serious choke holds and, in turn, you are put into serious choke holds by every other person in class, you learn something about others that you cannot learn from a face-to-face conversation.  Serious means that a person has to tap out or loses consciousness.

3) Play and humor matter in anything -- they are especially important in training and teambuilding. We need more class clowns; but those class clowns also need to handle being slapped.

4) Training should not end when the sessions wrap up.  Most of the commentary should occur AFTER the training session rather than during it.  By the same token there is something to be said for training prerequisites.
