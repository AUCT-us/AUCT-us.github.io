# Design

What is the GOAL of the Design for Immunity project? We might not think about it as much as we should, but ALL of us basically want to boost our immune system.  We all want to be healthier tomorrow than we are today.  

Anyone who is serious about health [and strengthening immunity against all kinds of attacks] knows that there's a LOT to think about ... almost TOO MUCH ... so should think about the scope of the project or about what we might focus on FIRST.

As a SPECIFIC example ... to prove the concept in a practical manner that demonstrates how one might incorporate particular interests, I will be look in at how I can learn about designing, building and continuously improving an edible foodscape on small amount of land that house sits on.  This foodscape will need to provides me with all kinds of antioxidants and phytochemicals and raw foods that I not only LIKE, but also are especially conductive to rebuilding my immune system.

As a starting point, for getting a general idea of the "lay of the land" for this project, I will attempt curate an AWESOME annotated reading list that looks at things like the types of [nutritional programs recommended for those undergoing radiation or chemotherapy or other particular toxic treatments for cancer](https://www.cancertutor.com/mirror_lymphoma/) ... but the background research, derived from curating and annotating a reading list is ONLY for making informed choices about this project.

The MOST important informed choice that I can make about the SCOPE of this particular immunity project is deciding the general strategy that I will use for attacking the opportunity ... I will refer to my Design For Immunity approach as a meta-immunity approach ... it will be about building the informational infrastructure for continually advancing the PRACTICAL, PERSONAL goal of improving my level of immunity.  To accomplish this, *we* ... I recognize the NEED to reach out, build upon what others have done ... *WE* will be designing a set of cloneable, forkable, open source repositories to construct a dynamic, continuously updatable system that helps people get information and data, learn on their own, build a lifestyle that takes responsibility for caring for ones environment in a way that strengthens immune systems and generally builds health.

# Methodology

It's really about open-sourcing education and aggressively developing ways to tap the power of community knowledge in learn how to live better and healthier, to replace bad habits with healthier ones and steadily build the foundations of things that build immunity to get stronger and stronger, little by little ... data APIs, repositories, MOOCs, JUPYTER notebooks, Electron driven messaging like Slack, online conferences [with LIVEstreamed video and more-or-less immediate interaction]

# Analytics

Eventually, people will stop playing defense and just being spooked by the #JustWorryAboutIt passive strategies used by conventional healthcare systems ... when get serious about [re]building immunity / fitness / productivity, we will recursively develop metrics by measuring, comparing, quantitatively optimizing and then analyzing or tracking improvements in performance. To be sure, healthcare options are [tracked and analyzed at the state level](https://www.mercatus.org/hoap), but where the analytics are really necessary is at the individual level. #DontGetSick

# Improvement

Improvement is driven by nothing other than disciplined, intelligently-applied, focused EFFORT ... analytics can give you idea of where you should focus or how effective parts of your effort has been, eg consider reps, weight, distance, time in an exercise regimen, but they cannot replace EFFORT. There are ways to improve more effectively, but there are no shortcuts, no way around putting in the EFFORT.

# Community

We envision an explosion of data-driven immunity / fitness / productivity social communities ... this includes things like the democratization of genome wide association studies and things made possible by affordable, portable nanopore DNA sequencer
