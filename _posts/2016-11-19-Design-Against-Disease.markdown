# Design

What is the GOAL of the Design for Immunity project? We might not think about it as much as we should, but ALL of us basically want to boost our immune system.  We all want to be healthier tomorrow than we are today.  

Anyone who is serious about health [and strengthening immunity against all kinds of attacks] knows that there's a LOT to think about ... almost TOO MUCH ... so should think about the scope of the project or about what we might focus on FIRST.

As a SPECIFIC example ... to prove the concept in a practical manner that demonstrates how one might incorporate particular interests, I will be look in at how I can learn about designing, building and continuously improving an edible foodscape on small amount of land that house sits on.  This foodscape will need to provides me with all kinds of antioxidants and phytochemicals and raw foods that I not only LIKE, but also are especially conductive to rebuilding my immune system.

As a starting point, for getting a general idea of the "lay of the land" for this project, I will attempt curate an AWESOME annotated reading list that looks at things like the types of [nutritional programs recommended for those undergoing radiation or chemotherapy or other particular toxic treatments for cancer](https://www.cancertutor.com/mirror_lymphoma/) ... but the background research, derived from curating and annotating a reading list is ONLY for making informed choices about this project.

The MOST important informed choice that I can make about the SCOPE of this particular immunity project is deciding the general strategy that I will use for attacking the opportunity ... I will refer to my Design For Immunity approach as a meta-immunity approach ... it will be about building the informational infrastructure for continually advancing the PRACTICAL, PERSONAL goal of improving my level of immunity.  To accomplish this, *we* ... I recognize the NEED to reach out, build upon what others have done ... *WE* will be designing a set of cloneable, forkable, open source repositories to construct a dynamic, continuously updatable system that helps people get information and data, learn on their own, build a lifestyle that takes responsibility for caring for ones environment in a way that strengthens immune systems and generally builds health.

# Methodology

ONE way of looking at good behavior is how productive [and generally higher-earning] behavior gets monetized into something like [strong housing prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). We all know some things about housing already -- for example, we know that the age of the something like carpet or even a furnace is going to be orders of magnitude less important than location or proximity to a good school or other community amenities.  AFTER we have prepared our data set [by eliminating obvious outliers in the data], we could BEGIN our exploratory analysis by looking at the different housing districts by using a [random forest model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) in order to assure that we are comparing basically similar neighborhoods.

Why just look at Ames ... let's look at ALL real estate in Iowa.  Or the world.

# Improvement

Design your COMMUNITY for Maintainability ... and the maintainability of better neighbors, better neighborhoods, better public utilities, better civic projects ... is important as a [derived] value because maintainability means thinking about other people. That includes the differing valid motives, aptitudes, stage of education and levels of capabilities of OTHER developers.

# Community

It is all about building an social architecture or *culturescape* that engenders people in the future [after you are gone] to go about maintaining their ability to be creative, productive, independent and free to protect themselves and advance their just causes [without hurting other people]. Of course, it is NECESSARY that choices about maintainability are voluntary -- a good argument with a useful tool should be sufficient to convince most people to go along with a policy -- coercion, force and mandates are unnecessary. Controlling others or taking away the independence of others is one of the very most immoral things that anyone can do. Open source code and data are part of this -- so are distributed information, defense and security.
