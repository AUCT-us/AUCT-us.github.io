The rise of AI assistants [based on large language models, which can parse gargantuam amounts of bullshit text] really illustrates more than anything else how easy it is to get excited by terminology, jargon and ideas that excessively complex technobabble that sounds ridiculously sophisticated.

The questions given below explore mart contract-based automated market makers (AMMs) and how distributed [crytocurrency] exchanges (DEX) or peer-to-peer marketplace where transactions occur directly between crypto traders, not as human beings but as technological agents; since the technology itself represents something of a hurdle for many people, there is the illusion that these sorts of marketplaces are brand new and so advanced that others such as auctioneers or floor traders on commodity or currency exchanges couldn't possibly understand the concepts.  

Economically, there is nothing particularly advanced about how these markets work, however, DEX technological requirements and MEV considerations fundamentally reshaped the jargon of not just DeFi protocols, but even the discussions of issues behind the programming necessary for the underlying blockchain infrastructure itself. The evolution from simple transaction ordering to sophisticated block building markets represents one of the most fascinating examples of emergent complexity, especially jargon complexity and the explosion of the buzzword space. 

Words do matter. It is necessary to exploring this whole topic superficially or to get a feel for the *lay of the land** before really diving deeper to explore many of these areas in more detail. Yes the jargon can be somewhat infuriating, but it's important to *drink from the firehose* in terms of terminology and jargon, in order to understand more about asking more probing questions about what is really happen economically or to understand how/why these markets still manage to convey information, in spite of the out of control tech jargon.

In other words, the following questions provide a rapid introduction which can be the basis to really dive deeper to begin to understand more nuanced concepts such as [Maximal Extractable Value](https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/mev-maximal-extractable-value-in-crypto-explainer) or MEV manifests in various forms, each with its own implications for blockchain participants. As the blockchain space matured, particularly with the rise of Proof-of-Stake and DeFi, the concept of MEV broadened. It now covers a wider range of participants, from validators to arbitrage bots. Key types of MEV include arbitrage, front-running, and sandwich attacks, all of which involve strategic transaction ordering to extract value at the expense of other network users. 

At first we might focus on unforeseen emergent phenomena and key lessons learned from DEX evolution, with particular attention to unexpected positive developments.
