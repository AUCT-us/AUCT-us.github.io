[Start with an intent to opensource a project](https://register.nvidia.com/flow/nvidia/gtcs24/attendeeportaldigital/page/sessioncatalog/session/1695673049743001rLIc) ... develop a CULTURE of OPEN and reproducible research, development, sharing, collaboration and EXTENSIBILITY ... [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch) is ONE example of a research project that was initiated by people [who were attracted to an employer supporting open source] working in an open source R&D teams inside a for-profit company and supported by the management of that company. That company, [Meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI) not only been built initial on open source technology, but by founders who recognized the cultural significance of open source and thus had developed a [set of policies and mgmt directives that established a culture of OPENSOURCING its R&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Neural_Network_Exchange).

Opensourcism is a better-**informed**, more thoroughly and completely thought through virtuous circle, ie, it's not just about ***believing*** without questioning in a *nice* thought, but actually understanding the fundamental, hard first-principles driving the cultural idiom of [*what comes around goes around*](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/what+goes+around+comes+around).  Open source is about working with the best million engineers in the world rather than working with the five or ten people who are knowledgable engineers contributing to a technology ... so it's not surprising that open source as a management paradigm is bound to produce significantly more intelligent, resilient and simple technology in the longer term because open-source is significantly more competitive, because this open approach is so much more globally-aware. Closed source technology is a indication of lower intelligence, less likely to sustain success, less likely to be able to adapt to change, less likely to be able to care about customers, less likely to be able to be able to care about and extensibly adapt and scale to the needs of employees, investors, stakeholders.
