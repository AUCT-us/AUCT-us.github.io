It WAS time to really get after it on Git a decade ago, now it REALLY is.

Git keeps surpassing expectations and changing how creative people collaborate.  Git is an EVEN bigger deal than Linus Torvalds imagined when it would be when he first developed Git ... bigger than the founders of Github imagined it would ever be when they founded Github ... bigger than pundits imagined when they reported on how almost all software developers were moving to Git.

# Git is not just for code

Git works well for distributed version control for ALL collaborative creative content.

# Git is not just secure

SHA 1 and paying close attention to Git logs is not absolutely perfect, but it's pretty damned good and the Git community is making Git more secure.

# Git is not just for managing collaboration

As far as one looks on the horizon, there's no end to the better and better tools for better visibility into the details of collaboration, better optimization and tracking of code reviews, better code quality and all kinds of different metrics of effectiveness.

# WHY hasn't mastering Git been one of the priorities of anyone involved in the creation of creative content?

Good question. As another person who's behind the curve on Git, I have NO good answer on that one ... it's like the answer for why I don't get up at 4:30 every single morning to do calisthenics.  I dunno.  I should. I haven't. I know that I should.
