*My ONLY purpose in life is to understand and celebrate my Creator's will.*

It's worth repeating ... with emphasis.

**My ONLY purpose in life is to understand and celebrate my Creator's will.**

The degree to which I should care about anything else is a derivative of my desire to know and understand my Creator's will. I do get distracted by other things, but those other distractions cause me to become MISERABLE.

I certainly do not understand my Creator's will completely, so I MUST pay more attention to understanding my Creator's will than anything else in the world. In a practical manner, this sole driving purpose must drive the prioritization of my time and that means that I must focus on my constant prayer that my Creator's will be done. 

# The Creator's will is ultimately drives the Universe toward a point of PERFECTION.

The human species is a TINY INSIGNIFICANT PART of the Universe ... the only thing that is truly amazing about humans is the incredibly high opinion that humans have of their species or of humanity. The human species and EVERY last thing that the human species sets in motion will always be a TINY INSIGNIFICANT PART of the Universe ... and the significance of this portion of the Universe is inversely proportional to the species' opinion of its significance, ie the more hubristic the opinion that humans have, the more likely they are to sow the seeds of their demise.  

It's neither my Creator's will that I have children nor is it my Creator's will that I do not have children. 

I do know that I am much, much, MUCH happier WITHOUT having to worry about children ... what I have learned again and again, so that now I can be absolutely certain, is that relationships, particularly close family relationships tend to make me absolutely miserable and physically ill ... even though these relationship are **absolutely great** in small doses, when there is no pressure to spend more time tomorrow, next month or at some *family* time next year. I am fabulously happy ***precisely*** because I can enjoy presence of my Creator, without having to ever bother with entertaining other people or worry about continually making provisions for the insatiable needs of a family.

There are those who tell me that the world would end if everyone thought like me ... which is demonstrably laughable on several levels ... first of all, there are over 8 billion of my species on this planet and it is quite apparent that there's ZERO risk whatsoever that the human population will seriously decline below the point where it has totally subdued all other lifeforms on planet ... secondly, my Creator might not send another flood to erase a species that he has second thoughts about, but it's probably that is something else cataclysmic in store, not necessarily next year or in the next 1000 years -- but EVENTUALLY. If that happens, the planet and the rest of creation will be better off without human beings ... bringing on the cataclysm is not my call, but I am also not going to waste any time worrying about what might bring it on.  **The Creator's will is ultimately drives the Universe toward a point of PERFECTION.**
