There are all kinds of LITTLE ... and some times, not so little ... things that impact your workflow on GitHub ... and it's up to YOU to stay engaged, to have a degree of situational awareness ... perhaps patiences ... perhaps an understanding of what you need to change.

Forgot about what you might believe ... you simply are NOT **entitled** to help from anyone else ... including even GitHub.

Now ... the folks at GitHub probably want to help you, but there might be impediments to IMMEDIATELY serving you ... maybe you haven't phrased your question intelligently or in a manner that fits their jargon and linguistic realm ... maybe there are problems with people who supply services to them; maybe they have their own glitches or bugs or issues ... there are all kinds of reasons why the latency of their service might vary.  It's not a perfect world.  And, even though we probably should not FIRST suspect malicious intent, since it's so much more likely that OTHER things are driving actions, there ARE indeed very malevolent actors out there -- not just hackers who want to take down a service like Github for their own idiotic purposes, but maybe's it WORSE ... like some EVIL national security agency of a totalitarian regime of thugs might be forcing Github to supply data or obstruct free speech.  We have reasons for why we should LOVE Github, but ... even if their intentions are better, purer, smarter than anyone else's ... you simply are NOT **entitled** to expect IMMEDIATE help from anyone else ... including GitHub.

The FIRST thing to look at is your own [lack of CURRENT] knowledge about your own set-up ... for example ... recently, I was working on a blog with the same Atom Editor and GitHub Desktop tools I've come to know and love ... and use somewhat successfully [for my modest purposes] ... using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a SIMPLE blog-aware static [GH pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) site generator on my laptop ... good ol' [127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000) looked as current and good [ie what I expected to see] as ever ... there had been no error messages from the editor or desktop app ... I had up to date version of each ... the updated pages were in Github's repo and I could see them on Github's website ... but Github was not loading my updated pages for some reason!!!  

SO IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO RELAX and spend a couple minutes RELEARNING SOME STUFF ... I had used the Github pages MAGIC and *it just worked* ... like MAGIC ... I didn't need to know AND I didn't know some key portions of the magic ... I had trusted Github TOO MUCH ... I know better ... you cannot trust ANYONE, even people who are on your side and do not want to deliberate screw up your workflow ... that includes even Github ... most importantly YOU CANNOT PLACE ALL OF YOUR FAITH MAGIC YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ... if you're going to rely on magic, at least build in some redundancies, just in case, things like [how GitHub serve pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/) and [how they have recently updated it do it NOW](https://github.com/blog/2228-simpler-github-pages-publishing) don't perform as you think they will, when you need a service to perform for you.

The fact of the matter is that if you rely upon Github ... and you probably should rely on GitHub ... at least, you should *sort of* rely on them and even if you are a competitor of them, you should pay attentin because Github is pretty good at what they do ... even for things that are not mission-critical for *your* mission, but if your mission involves developing software, content, data science or building any form of knowledge, the fully network-effected social distributed version control that Github does is critical ... you really NEED to be reading the [GitHub blog](https://github.com/blog), following the [GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/user/github) and [Github Guides](https://www.youtube.com/user/GitHubGuides) channels on YouTube and maybe even attending and definitely paying attention to the [program](http://githubuniverse.com/program/) of topics and speakers [at GitHub conferences](http://githubuniverse.com/) ... you really should have an awareness of [what is going on at GitHub](https://octoverse.github.com/) and in the companies involved in providing distributed version control like [Git] ... after all, the whole toolchain and different services that you rely on for source control are kind of a big deal.
