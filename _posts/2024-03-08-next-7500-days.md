When anyone looks at the Social Security Actuarial tables, they can see that the average life expectancy of a 64 1/2 year old male in the United States is about 17.285 years or 6,313 days left to live ... ON AVERAGE, for the entire United States. There are reasons ...predominantly related to the physicality of worklives and tendency to minimize or abstain from alcohol, but there's possibly also a genetic component ... why the average life expectancy of a male of my age living where I do is approximately 3 to 4 years longer than the United States average.

Based on the actuarial data and adjustments to reflect actual local data, my own personal life expectancy to about 20.54 years or **I have about 7500 days left to live.**

*OKAY, OKAY, OKAY ... I get it ... yes, I know that it looks as if I kinda fudged my expected lifespan calculations to come out at 7500 days* ...***and maybe I did, just a bit.*** 

*But does it matter?* The whole POINT of this exercise is time mgmt and giving myself an appropriate understanding of the scarcity of my time left so that I don't DAWDLE.

Conversely, I don't want to do what a lot of people do around the time that I have to make a choice about which Medicare plan to go with ... they turn **overly** risk averse and sort cower, shell-shocked by the bombardment of mailers from AARP, the funeral home about making sure one's death ceremony plans are taken care or the barrage of Medicare supplement materials and phone calls one gets after turning 64.


I am not exactly sure that people cower in fear of dying and turn into a STUPID crybaby believing that they're GOING to die *tomorrow* ... but the thing is, there's a tendency at 65 to take the offense off the field and just play a full-court press of prevent defense.  Well, I'm not going to do that ...

Of course, I know damned well that I **might** indeed die tommorow or maybe within the next five minutes for that matter ...  but it really does not matter. 

**For planning purposes, I need to use the BEST UNBIASED ESTIMATE of my life expectancy ... and rounding it to 7500 days is just practical PLANNING.**


FOR THE SAKE OF RESPONSIBLE PLANNING, I need a rough estimate of a timeline ... I am not going to constrain the goals, objectives and plans of what I want to do with rest of my life by such pathetically cowardly fear of any imminent death *unless I receive some medical diagnosis that gives me something like "hours or days, but not weeks left to live."*  On the other hand, and also, for the sake of responsible FINANCIAL planning, I should not assume that I will die before I am 150 or 200 or so *even though those last years as I close on 200 might be covered strictly by my Social Security check, if my investments don't pan out ...*

# For PLANNING purposes ... I am going to assume that I have 7500 moderately healthy, moderately productive days left.

I hope to have MORE moderately healthy, moderately productive days left ... that's maybe the most important part of the next 7500 days, ie to keep breaking the bad habits that I accumulated in the first fifty years of being my UNHEALTHY self ... before I RETIRED.

But somehow I made it to 50 and retired to work on my own projects ... which was rewarding AND I probably would not have made it to 55 if ONE of those project was investing in and working in the philanthropic realm of health improvement and finding ways to encourage mor martial arts dojos to start up.

Retiring at 50 is something that I would recommend to anyone ... even for those who think that they might not have enough money. {**BIG HINT: The more that you can do to reduce your living expenses to next to nothing, the happier your retirement will be -- in spite of what elder-vacay advertisers, insurance salesmen and pharma parasites want you to believe, happieness in retirement does not accrue to those with a open wallet spending on things that the retirement demographic consumes at 25X to 100X the rate they should swallow those poisons at.**} 

In my case, retiring at 50 GAVE me the opportunity to spend EVERY DAY with my father, in his last 18 months, which furnished me with indispensable insights about my own health and the work I needed do on my own physiscal self, to save my own life ... I also got to see the impact of his own recalcitrance. It was the PAIN that recalcitrance caused him that really opened my eyes to how [THE fundamental flaw in humans, especially OLD MEN, is their own ***stiff-neckedness***](https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-9.htm) ... it's all about the the manner in which we humans, particularly us OLD MEN, absolutely ***cling*** to OLD WAYS, even when those old nasty habits of being our unhealthy selves were basically the implements that we used to enslave ourselves. 

**The MOST IMPORTANT gift that I ever gave myself was the TIME time [spent sitting with my father] just thinking about how I had wasted my life trying to be a professional and successful investor.**

At 50, I was a PROFESSIONAL with an okish professional resume, that I had built mostly just by luck and by imitating what others were doing -- my professional career was definitely NOT the result of any coherent planning effort ... mostly, I didn't like thinking about career advancement and professional planning that much. I was just sorta faking it ... but I was as good at faking as almost anybody else was who was ***really*** trying to do it..

On the other hand, at 50 I actually ***was*** definitely a success as an investor, ie my investing success is how I could retire at 50; it was not really as the result of my work as a Federal agent, in academia, in industry or in private business ... I retired because of the connections I WORKED at making in my professional life directly influenced my ability to bypass news and propaganda to make better investments. It was the long-term performance of my trading and following those investments [as risky and unpredicable as that performance was] made it possible to me retire ... so making new CONNECTIONS with people who are doing especially compelling stuff will ALWAYS be important to me ... just as it will ALWAYS be important to me to keep my living expenses to the barest of bare minimums so that I NEVER HAVE TO WORRY about the risks that necessarily come with genuinely important ventures that create radically better opportunities for people. 

Tolerance for risk along with the push to make new connections is what I have to do to make the most of the next 7500 days ... but I also have to break the hardened, calcified old habits of being my terrible unhealthy self and I will need to plan and work harder transform the old me into somone who is becoming MUCH MORE disciplined and MORE perseverant in my health and exercise ... even if that discipline and perseverance costs me old friendships; I need the disipline and perseverance more than I need the friendships with people who have given up on themselves and are not willing to work on their health and exercise.

Part of having a good offense, and being mentally shrewd enough to assess risks/rewards of new opportunities comes from aggressively working on one's health EVERY SINGLE DAY.

One MUST BE healthier tomorrow and better able to train and stay more fit ... I know how important this is because I did not do it, UNTIL I was well into my mid 50s ... before that I would tend to get sick or my Dockers would get tight and THEN I would react for the next few months or maybe even years with a TOTALLY MYOPIC get-fit-now diet or exercise program ... but I took my health for granted, just as I took it for granted that things would work out just fine if I just didn't ignore the signals and *got after it* with discipline and perseverance working diligantly each day on health and exercise to make the corrections I needed to make ... but I did NOT actually plan; my discipline and perservance was a matter of REACTION ... when the alarms went off and I got some sort of wake up call telling that my health was trying to tell me that it was time to work on making some corrections ... but until I was at least 55 I had no long term plan for what I NEEDED to do in order to get healthier ... I burned health as fuel to work on different distractions, some were actually defensible and laudable, but most were just about IMITIATING what successful professionals who I looked up to seemed to do in their careers ... *[without much in the way of seriously PLANNING about what my life was supposed to be about].*

At this point in my life, I will confess that there is a big part of me that is fully ready to just die RIGHT NOW ... I look forward to whatever comes after this life ... I completely trust my Creator to provide the next step for me ... I expect that the final processes of dying will be extremely and even tediously painful so I will confess that hope death comes quickly ... but I really dunno if that step after life will be easy or enjoyable or much of anything about that next step ... I dunno if anything about this existence will inform that next step after life; I don't even know if the whole concept of Time and one event following another will apply ... whatever comes next is far to too different to bother contemplating and it simply cannot be allowed to become something I worry about ... I just LOVE my Creator and I accept Jesus Christ as my sole path to being with my Creator, I love my Creator more than I love life itself, which also means that I love my Creator more than I love any of my fellow humans ... I LOVE my Creator and trust that the next step will be whatever the next step is willed to be by my Creator.

**My ONLY purpose in life is to try each day to understand my life in the context of my Creator's will and to CELEBRATE each moment cognizant of that understanding.** I can do this while getting other practical things done, but my prayer that my Creator's will be done must always must come first ... it must inform everything that I do, but it also implicitly recognizes that ONLY I can be responsible for my planning for my future and that I must be responsible for my own actions and the consequences of those actions.

## What will I do with my last 7500 days of productive time on Earth?

It's worthy of repitition ... **My ONLY purpose in life is to try each day to understand my life in the context of my Creator's will and to CELEBRATE each moment cognizant of that understanding.** I can do this while getting other practical things done, but my prayer that my Creator's will be done must always must come first ... it must inform everything that I do, but it also implicitly recognizes that ONLY I can be responsible for my planning for my future and that I must be responsible for my own actions and the consequences of those actions.

The necessary practical details that I need to attend to in my last 7500 days or just over two years or so of productive time left on Earth are get my affairs in order so that I can dispose of the remaining details in my last 750 days ... or possibly even less if some sort of health crisis or accident arises ... but, I don't need to have every last detail buttoned up and tidy as if it'd all be taken care of tomorrow. First of all, I still have to LIVE and DO THINGS and maybe try to accomplish something financially or philanthropically ... if I die tomorrow, there are sufficient assets in my estate to compensate my heirs for the problems of having to dispose of my stuff.

### The MAIN thing that I WANT to do is just focus on *putting points on the board*

I can say this, after having focused on my health so that I have gotten significantly more healthy over the last 17 years or so ... when on March 9, 2007 I was told that I would likely die from sepsis within hours or few days, but that I did not have a week left to live ... I have crawled out of a state of believing that I faced imminent death OR that I would likely soon relapse into that state where I faced imminent death. In the decade or so after being told that I would likely die in hours, I sort of ceased believing that I should ever start something that I would not likely finish ... the shadow of impending death sort of pre-occupied my thinking ... and that was probably actually a blessing, because I had the opportunity to come to terms with my mortality in ways that people who have not had the executioner's axe hanging over their neck have never had to contemplate. I am better for that experience ... but I ***need to RETURN TO focusing on putting points on the board*** *except that now it's a more informed view of what that means*, ie I need to work in the realm of OPEN source technologies, which PRIMARILY a philanthropic push, but it does not necessarily eschew financial gain, since I have some hope that my technological expertise might inform my investment selections.

I need to THINK in terms of a 20 year agenda, rather than something I can finish in 2 months or 2 years. I have been far too conservative although Ecclesiastically it was necessary to go through a prolonged period of more intense, even sometimes angry/frustrated **contemplation**, it is now necessary to put the offense back on the field and try to put some points on the board.

## What will I do with my last 750 days of productive time on Earth?

It's worthy of repitition AGAIN ... **My ONLY purpose in life is to try each day to understand my life in the context of my Creator's will and to CELEBRATE each moment cognizant of that understanding.** I can do this while getting other practical things done, but my prayer that my Creator's will be done must always must come first ... it must inform everything that I do, but it also implicitly recognizes that ONLY I can be responsible for my planning for my future and that I must be responsible for my own actions and the consequences of those actions.

The main practical thing that I need to accomplish in my last 750 days or just over two years or so of productive time left on Earth is to get my affairs somewhat tidied up into a manageable enough group so so that I can assist my heirs in disposing of the remaining details of my life in my last 75 days ... but **I will put off the final disposal until I actually do have just 75 days left** because the main thing that I still need to be chasing in the first part of my final 750 days on Earth is putting more points on the board ... to borrow a metaphor from football, it's STUPID to turn ultra-conservative and put in the *prevent defense* before the final possession; until then **the best defense is a strong offense.**

After all, it MAY become overwhelmingly apparent that I will have a brand new 750 day or 1000 day or 500 day lease on life, which will mean that I still have to try to put some points on the board ... conversely, I feel fine now but I might be told next month that I have just a couple months or at most 75 days left to live -- when that happens I will shift immediately to the final disposal of the remaining details of my life that I had planned to complete in the final 75 days of my life.

## What will I do with my last 75 days productive time on Earth?

It's worthy of repitition yet AGAIN ... **My ONLY purpose in life is to try each day to understand my life in the context of my Creator's will and to CELEBRATE each moment cognizant of that understanding.** I can do this while getting other practical things done, but my prayer that my Creator's will be done must always must come first ... it must inform everything that I do, but it also implicitly recognizes that ONLY I can be responsible for my planning for my future and that I must be responsible for my own actions and the consequences of those actions.

In my last 75 days on Earth, I will be focused on the final disposal of the remaining details of my life ... I will put off the final disposal until I am kind of sure that I actually do have just 75 days left.

## What will I do with my last week or 75 hours of productive time left on Earth?

It's worthy of repitition OVER AND OVER until I die ... **My ONLY purpose in life is to try each day to understand my life in the context of my Creator's will and to CELEBRATE each moment cognizant of that understanding.** I can do this while getting other practical things done, but my prayer that my Creator's will be done must always must come first ... it must inform everything that I do, but it also implicitly recognizes that ONLY I can be responsible for my planning for what little time is left and how short my future appears to be. Until the end, it is me who must take full responsibility for my own actions and the consequences of those actions.

I have had the incredible luxury of recovering from an illness where the best doctors in the world believed, as I believed myself, that I would die within a few hours or at most days ... since I know what is entailed, I have made a point in my life of never waiting to tell someone something that I thought I would eventually need to tell them ... I don't have to worry about saying goodbye to people or making amends with people or anything like that ... I do not live in a manner waiting to make apologies; I also have zero regrets about ever offending anyone, because I truly believe the offense taken is on them -- I have tried to be brutally honest, forthright and deathly frank with people ... there's no room for hypocrisy or passive-aggressive NICE little manipulative lies ... 

I have certainly had periods of doubt and skepticsm, even depression and utter despair in which I simply could not think, to even put together a plan to tie my shoes. I NEVER have been one who goes out with an intention of picking fights, but I have let fights come to me for me to finish. I never been much of a coward ... I have called cowardice out and I have gotten used to being told that I am not as tough as I think I am. Of course, I know full well that my bravery is not something that I have earned, but rather it is only through the grace of my Creator that I have had any bravery or any toughness -- so it IS true that I am personally not that tough.

**It has also proven to be true that I become a billion or a trillion times tougher than I think I am when my Creator calls upon me.  People who are isolated from our Creator cannot possibly imagine this. They might imagine that this makes into some form of arrogant asshole or bully, I have only used bullying behavior when someone else attempted to bully me. I have killed and, whether I like it not, my Creator has created me as a ruthless killer; I don't kill without provokation, but I am quite certain that I will be capable of killing again when I am called upon to do so ... I will do whatever is needed in order to fight for my Creator's will; my most supreme wish of all of my wishes in my whole life is to DIE fighting for my Creator's will.**
