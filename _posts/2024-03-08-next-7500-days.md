When anyone looks at the Social Security Actuarial tables, they can see that the average life expectancy of a 64 1/2 year old male in the United States is about 17.285 years or 6,313 days left to live ... ON AVERAGE, for the entire United States. There are reasons ...predominantly related to the physicality of worklives and tendency to minimize or abstain from alcohol, but there's possibly also a genetic component ... why the average life expectancy of a male of my age living where I do is approximately 3 to 4 years longer than the United States average.

Based on the actuarial data and rational adjustments, I am going to adjust my personal life expectancy to about 20.54 years or about 7500 days left to live ... *OKAY, OKAY, OKAY ... yeah, I know that it looks as if I kinda fudged my expected lifespan calculations to come out at 7500 days*, ***and maybe I did,*** *but the POINT of this exercise is time mgmt and giving myself an appropriate understanding of the scarcity of my time left so that I don't DAWDLE ... conversely, I don't turn overly risk averse and cower in fear of dying and turn into a STUPID crybaby believing that I'm GOING to die tomorrow* ... of course, I **might** die tommorow or maybe within the next five minutes for that matter ...  but FOR THE SAKE OF RESPONSIBLE PLANNING, I am not going to constrain the goals, objectives and plans of what I want to do with rest of my life by such pathetically cowardly fear of any imminent death *unless I receive some medical diagnosis that gives me something like "hours or days, but not weeks left to live."*  Also, for the sake of responsible FINANCIAL planning, I should not assume that I will die before I am 150 or so *even though those last years might be covered strictly by my Social Security check, if my investments don't pan out ...*

# For PLANNING purposes ... I am going to assume that I have 7500 moderately healthy, moderately productive days.

**My ONLY purpose in life is to try each day to understand my life in the context of my Creator's will and to CELEBRATE each moment cognizant of that understanding.** I can do this while getting other practical things done, but my prayer that my Creator's will be done must always must come first ... it must inform everything that I do, but it also implicitly recognizes that ONLY I can be responsible for my planning for my future and that I must be responsible for my own actions and the consequences of those actions.

## What will I do with my last 7500 days of productive time on Earth?

It's worthy of repitition ... **My ONLY purpose in life is to try each day to understand my life in the context of my Creator's will and to CELEBRATE each moment cognizant of that understanding.** I can do this while getting other practical things done, but my prayer that my Creator's will be done must always must come first ... it must inform everything that I do, but it also implicitly recognizes that ONLY I can be responsible for my planning for my future and that I must be responsible for my own actions and the consequences of those actions.

The necessary practical details that I need to attend to in my last 7500 days or just over two years or so of productive time left on Earth are get my affairs in order so that I can dispose of the remaining details in my last 750 days ... or possibly even less if some sort of health crisis or accident arises ... but, I don't need to have every last detail buttoned up and tidy as if it'd all be taken care of tomorrow. First of all, I still have to LIVE and DO THINGS and maybe try to accomplish something financially or philanthropically ... if I die tomorrow, there are sufficient assets in my estate to compensate my heirs for the problems of having to dispose of my stuff.

### The MAIN thing that I WANT to do is just focus on *putting points on the board*

I can say this, after having focused on my health so that I have gotten significantly more healthy over the last 17 years or so ... when on March 9, 2007 I was told that I would likely die from sepsis within hours or few days, but that I did not have a week left to live ... I have crawled out of a state of believing that I faced imminent death OR that I would likely soon relapse into that state where I faced imminent death. In the decade or so after being told that I would likely die in hours, I sort of ceased believing that I should ever start something that I would not likely finish ... the shadow of impending death sort of pre-occupied my thinking ... and that was probably actually a blessing, because I had the opportunity to come to terms with my mortality in ways that people who have not had the executioner's axe hanging over their neck have never had to contemplate. I am better for that experience ... but I ***need to RETURN TO focusing on putting points on the board*** *except that now it's a more informed view of what that means*, ie I need to work in the realm of OPEN source technologies, which PRIMARILY a philanthropic push, but it does not necessarily eschew financial gain, since I have some hope that my technological expertise might inform my investment selections.

I need to THINK in terms of a 20 year agenda, rather than something I can finish in 2 months or 2 years. I have been far too conservative although Ecclesiastically it was necessary to go through a prolonged period of more intense, even sometimes angry/frustrated **contemplation**, it is now necessary to put the offense back on the field and try to put some points on the board.

## What will I do with my last 750 days of productive time on Earth?

It's worthy of repitition AGAIN ... **My ONLY purpose in life is to try each day to understand my life in the context of my Creator's will and to CELEBRATE each moment cognizant of that understanding.** I can do this while getting other practical things done, but my prayer that my Creator's will be done must always must come first ... it must inform everything that I do, but it also implicitly recognizes that ONLY I can be responsible for my planning for my future and that I must be responsible for my own actions and the consequences of those actions.

The main practical thing that I need to accomplish in my last 750 days or just over two years or so of productive time left on Earth is to get my affairs somewhat tidied up into a manageable enough group so so that I can assist my heirs in disposing of the remaining details of my life in my last 75 days ... but **I will put off the final disposal until I actually do have just 75 days left** because the main thing that I still need to be chasing in the first part of my final 750 days on Earth is putting more points on the board ... to borrow a metaphor from football, it's STUPID to turn ultra-conservative and put in the *prevent defense* before the final possession; until then **the best defense is a strong offense.**

After all, it MAY become overwhelmingly apparent that I will have a brand new 750 day or 1000 day or 500 day lease on life, which will mean that I still have to try to put some points on the board ... conversely, I feel fine now but I might be told next month that I have just a couple months or at most 75 days left to live -- when that happens I will shift immediately to the final disposal of the remaining details of my life that I had planned to complete in the final 75 days of my life.

## What will I do with my last 75 days productive time on Earth?

It's worthy of repitition yet AGAIN ... **My ONLY purpose in life is to try each day to understand my life in the context of my Creator's will and to CELEBRATE each moment cognizant of that understanding.** I can do this while getting other practical things done, but my prayer that my Creator's will be done must always must come first ... it must inform everything that I do, but it also implicitly recognizes that ONLY I can be responsible for my planning for my future and that I must be responsible for my own actions and the consequences of those actions.

In my last 75 days on Earth, I will be focused on the final disposal of the remaining details of my life ... I will put off the final disposal until I am kind of sure that I actually do have just 75 days left.

## What will I do with my last week or 75 hours of productive time left on Earth?

It's worthy of repitition OVER AND OVER until I die ... **My ONLY purpose in life is to try each day to understand my life in the context of my Creator's will and to CELEBRATE each moment cognizant of that understanding.** I can do this while getting other practical things done, but my prayer that my Creator's will be done must always must come first ... it must inform everything that I do, but it also implicitly recognizes that ONLY I can be responsible for my planning for what little time is left and how short my future appears to be. Until the end, it is me who must take full responsibility for my own actions and the consequences of those actions.

I have had the incredible luxury of recovering from an illness where the best doctors in the world believed, as I believed myself, that I would die within a few hours or at most days ... since I know what is entailed, I have made a point in my life of never waiting to tell someone something that I thought I would eventually need to tell them ... I don't have to worry about saying goodbye to people or making amends with people or anything like that ... I do not live in a manner waiting to make apologies; I also have zero regrets about ever offending anyone, because I truly believe the offense taken is on them -- I have tried to be brutally honest, forthright and deathly frank with people ... there's no room for hypocrisy or passive-aggressive NICE little manipulative lies ... 

I have certainly had periods of doubt and skepticsm, even depression and utter despair in which I simply could not think, to even put together a plan to tie my shoes. I NEVER have been one who goes out with an intention of picking fights, but I have let fights come to me for me to finish. I never been much of a coward ... I have called cowardice out and I have gotten used to being told that I am not as tough as I think I am. Of course, I know full well that my bravery is not something that I have earned, but rather it is only through the grace of my Creator that I have had any bravery or any toughness -- so it IS true that I am personally not that tough.

**It has also proven to be true that I become a billion or a trillion times tougher than I think I am when my Creator calls upon me.  People who are isolated from our Creator cannot possibly imagine this. They might imagine that this makes into some form of arrogant asshole or bully, I have only used bullying behavior when someone else attempted to bully me. I have killed and, whether I like it not, my Creator has created me as a ruthless killer; I don't kill without provokation, but I am quite certain that I will be capable of killing again when I am called upon to do so ... I will do whatever is needed in order to fight for my Creator's will; my most supreme wish of all of my wishes in my whole life is to DIE fighting for my Creator's will.**
