## Practical DAO Implementation Questions Lead Us to Be Counter-Revolutionaries.

What are the practical experiences and lessons learned from actual DAO implementations? Do DAO actually have a chance of working well enough to displace the status quo OR is it **more likely that status quo can evolve by picking and choosing lessons from DAO implementations**? We believe that it's the latter, but that's just our belief because DECENTRALIZED *sounds* nice, but means there is no one central high-agency *buck stops here* defending authority *minding the store. We do believe that DAOs are an exceptionally important development shaping the governance approach used by humans, but we strongly believe that traditional systems can better evolve by picking and choosing lessons RATHER than humans opting for a revolution to overthrow the status quo.  It makes sense for us to start our evaluation by looking at goverance structure and group decision-making.

# Governance Structure and Decision-Making

Efficient, dynamic environments depend upon high-agency people fighting for the environment, not upon catering to victims who choose victimhood or whiners who choose to complain rather than to fix bad situations. Over time, DAOs struggle with coordination issues, voter apathy, "whale" domination, in which large token holders, exemplifying selfish high-agency, figure out *the game* in order to wield disproportionate power. It remains to be seen whether effective governance mechanisms can be sustained for crucial levels of participation and equitable decision-making. Of course, the legal and regulatory status of DAOs will continue to be ambiguous in many jurisdictions, creating regulatory risks. In conclusion, DAOs are a work in progress. Their success depends on continuous innovation, adaptation, a strong commitment to democratic principles ... and leadership from especially high-agency people who understand that technical mechanisms are not a substitute for the cultivation of new generations of leaders.

Key strategies have emerged, but there are nothing on the horizon that comes close to being a panacea. DAOs can implement layered governance in a tiered system lets a core team handle day-to-day tactical decisions; while major, strategic changes [including leadership of core team] get a broader vote. In this way, a small group can act quickly on specific issues and encourage knowledgeable members to step up, get more involved in order to advance to leadership. Successful DAOs focus on more clearly defining and generally simplifying decision-making processes, opting for clarity rather than adding clever spins, new flavors or cool features. An example of too many features might be multi-stage snapshot polling, with final voting -- it was believed that this gauges sentiment first, then generates discussion and consensus before final vote on single issues and since voting's easy, cheap, fast, and COULD boost participation by encouraging people to express opinions and have a say. Constant votes can lead to voter fatigue, apathy, thus hindering or even decreasing participation over time; it's impossible to resussitate a dying DAO. Continual improvement in openness of communication channels allow for higher quality participation in discussions, but improvement is a difficult, harrowing quest for better balance between efficient action and democratic participation. DAOs often struggle to grow beyond a core of enthusiastic promoters while maintaining democratic involvement of those with less skin in the game. Somebody needs to *mind the store*, since decentralized systems are vulnerable to new, before unforeseen attacks; eventually this will happen if there's actually anything to attack, if the system not properly secured and defended.

Somebody [it cannot be some thing] has to take responsibility for ***dynamically*** adjusting, to defend the DAO ... but the D in DAO is very much anti-DEFENDER, anti-DYNAMIC ... the decentralized mechanism is some sort of cool technology, such as an unbreakable crypto mechanism. Accordingly, the legal and regulatory status of DAOs is still murky at best in many geographies, especially in places where the govt itself is unstable, corrupt, and sees DAOs as threat to its sovereignty. DAOs hold significant **potential**, but their success hinges on navigating complex challenges. DAOs they ***MIGHT*** represent a paradigm shift in organizational structure, offering transparency, inclusivity, and automation. However, they're still in their nascent stage, and their long-term viability depends on overcoming existing hurdles. Many DAOs are actually working, and managing large sums of capital, so far ... they might be more than just a theoretical concept.There are security vulnerabilities ... for example, ["The DAO" hack in 2016](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/understanding-the-dao-attack) exposed the risks of smart contract vulnerabilities and underscored the critical need for not just rigorous security audits, but some sort of enforcement and defense policy to punish violators, root out perpetrators and eradicate sources of attack. 

Each of these challenges prompts at least ten different levels of new additional **goverance structure and group decision-making** questions that are unresolved and might remain unresolved ... but underpinning those questions there are also all kinds of questions about technical infrastructure, treasury management, member engagement and retention and ... at least 15-20 additional headings worth of even more questions.
