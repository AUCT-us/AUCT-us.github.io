OPTIMIZING carbon sequestration ... so that we maximize soil quality or fitness for use ... is the goal of the Soil Quality Laboratory philanthropy venture. HEALTHIER living soil ecosystems translate into more diverse, higher quality non-processed, fresh food and generally healthier people. The vision is for a food supply that is intensely local, ie right on someone's balcony or a rooftop or in a community garden or in some form of potager garden.

## Interrogating In-Situ Soil Ecology

The Laboratory part of the Soil Quality philanthropic venture will involve [transcriptomics technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptomics_technologies) and [highly parallel CRISPR inference](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/476366v1) to interrogate soil ecosystems. We will focus primarily on field laboratory techniques that are affordable and extremely lightweight, eg a small peripheral [system-on-chip(SOC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip) extension of a smartphone, but we are not interested in merely producing another cool nanofabricated gadget. Most importantly, the process of interrogating the soil ecosystem must radically minimize the disruption to the [in situ soil ecology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02379-5), since soil microbial communities develop along [electron transport chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_transport_chain), forming electrically conductive biofilms, and developing networks of [bacterial nanowires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_nanowires).  


After serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_analysis_of_gene_expression] and then [DNA sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing) by synthesis or the second-generation sequencing of [Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_parallel_sequencing) transcriptomics, researchers have embraced [more advanced techniques](https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-020-00103-7) to explore the [complexity of transcriptomes](https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-020-00107-3). 

[**Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS)**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/probe/docs/techmpss/) is a method for determining expression levels of mRNA by counting the number of individual mRNA molecules produced by each gene. It is "open ended" in the sense that the identity of the RNAs to be measured are not pre-determined as they are with gene expression microarrays. A sample of mRNA are first converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcriptase, which makes subsequent manipulations easier. These cDNA are fused to a small oligonucleotide "tag" which allows the cDNA to be PCR amplified and then coupled to microbeads. After several rounds of sequence determination, using hybridization of fluorescent labeled probes, a sequence signature of ~16–20 bp is determined from each bead. Fluorescent imaging captures the signal from all of the beads, while affixed to a 2-dimensional surface, so DNA sequences are determined from all the beads in parallel. There is some amplification of the starting material so, in the end, approximately 1,000,000 sequence reads are obtained per experiment.



Let's delve into [what have been the next generations in transcriptomics](https://omicstutorials.com/transcriptomcs-past-present-and-future/) or what it is referred to as [third-generation "long read" sequencing methods](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-8-153) or [high-throughput transcriptomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing#High-throughput_methods):

[Exome sequencing](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/d290623c4e715564443deb06f699e9746703e3aa/Whole-Exome-Sequencing%20Based-Identification-of-a-Novel-Gene-Involved-in-Root-Hair-Development-in-Barley-(Hordeum-vulgare-L.)/graph) also known as whole exome sequencing (WES), is a genomic technique for sequencing all of the protein-coding regions of genes in a genome (known as the exome). It consists of two steps: the first step is to select only the subset of DNA that encodes proteins. These regions are known as exons—humans have about 180,000 exons, constituting about 1% of the human genome, or approximately 30 million base pairs. The second step is to sequence the exonic DNA using any high-throughput DNA sequencing technology.The goal of this approach is to identify genetic variants that alter protein sequences, and to do this at a much lower cost than whole-genome sequencing. 


[RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq)](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/a98b8a1d5ce9ad451584556de40e41e91d5e6d5e/Species%20-and-site%20specific-genome-editing-in-complex-bacterial-communities/graph) is a technique that uses next-generation sequencing to reveal the presence and quantity of RNA molecules in a biological sample, providing a snapshot of gene expression in the sample, also known as transcriptome. Specifically, RNA-Seq facilitates the ability to look at alternative gene spliced transcripts, post-transcriptional modifications, gene fusion, mutations/SNPs and changes in gene expression over time, or differences in gene expression in different groups or treatments. In addition to mRNA transcripts, RNA-Seq can look at different populations of RNA to include total RNA, small RNA, such as miRNA, tRNA, and ribosomal profiling. RNA-Seq can also be used to determine exon/intron boundaries and verify or amend previously annotated 5' and 3' gene boundaries. Recent advances in RNA-Seq include single cell sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, in situ sequencing of fixed tissue, and native RNA molecule sequencing with single-molecule real-time sequencing. Other examples of emerging RNA-Seq applications due to the advancement of bioinformatics algorithms are copy number alteration, microbial contamination, transposable elements, cell type (deconvolution) and the presence of neoantigens. Prior to RNA-Seq, gene expression studies were done with hybridization-based microarrays. 

**Functional Annotation**: Once you've identified transcripts, the next step is to annotate their functions. This involves linking transcripts to specific biological processes, pathways, and cellular functions. Tools like gene ontology (GO) analysis and pathway enrichment help unravel the functional significance of different transcripts.

**Alternative Splicing Analysis**: RNA-seq data allows exploration of alternative splicing events. Investigate how different isoforms of a gene arise from the same pre-mRNA by analyzing splice junctions and exon usage patterns.

**Differential Expression Analysis**: Compare transcript levels between different conditions (e.g., healthy vs. diseased, treated vs. untreated). Tools like DESeq2 or edgeR identify genes showing significant expression changes.

**Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs)**: Beyond protein-coding genes, lncRNAs play crucial roles in gene regulation. Explore their functions and interactions.

**Single-Cell RNA-seq**: For cellular heterogeneity, single-cell RNA-seq provides insights into gene expression at the individual cell level. Understand cell types, developmental trajectories, and rare cell populations.

**Spatial Transcriptomics**: Investigate gene expression patterns within tissues. Techniques like spatial transcriptomics and in situ sequencing reveal where specific transcripts are active.

**Integration with Other Omics Data**: Combine RNA-seq with other omics data (e.g., DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility) to gain a holistic view of gene regulation.
