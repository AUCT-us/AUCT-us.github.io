The process of curation, like an exercise regimen, is intended to be never complete, to always be evolving, always being extended, refactored, refined ... but the repititions prevent atrophy ... and it is atrophy of our abilities rather than the acts of outsiders or aliens which we must fear most. The process of engaging in the ongoing scholarship of curation of knowledge development communities deepens, refines, sharpens, improves our knowledge and our ability to reason, think, express ourselves coherently over time.

# Building LIVING open source knowledge development communities

The reason for insisting upon fully open source materials is that we learn best from living OPEN source ***knowledge development communities*** ... it
s the community ... it's not just the end product or context-free factoid that we learn from. We learn best when we teach others and learn together; this works best when we all participate in building the resources and communities that we will rely on to advance our ability to learn.

Boundless curiosity and neverending rumination are the fundamentals necessary for knowledge development ... knowledge requires a seemingly infinite number of ruminations by a seemingly infinite community -- and there's always something more, always something that is good enough in some specific cases, but not good enough in the general case.  

Otherwise, we get the state of ANTI-knowledge known as Scientism ... worshipping scientific wonders without understand the science or its limits ...Scientism, like any dreadfully dangerous religous belief comes down to statements quoting high priests ... such as "So-and-so said such-and-such is true; so the Inquisition has ruled that the "Science is settled.'." That horrendous perversion of the scientific method is the dangerously insufficient, completely inaedequate state that even what passes for scientific knowledge is at today, eg *"Richard Feynman said it, so it must be true."*

The validity of Science depends, not upon annointed high priests, but rather upon a scientifically-literate population capable of questioning all authority ... and we do not have anything like a scientifically literate population, even we confine our investigation to the population of high school Science teachers. The tendency to worship the high priests of Scientism illustrates this clearly ... a person simply cannot be scientifically literate if they are always a member of the "Accept Authority" squad.

The scientific method requires RUMINATION and the kind of disciplined scholarship necessary for curating annoated lists of reading material ... we don't just read; we re-read ... it not just about what *IT* is, we learn from everything that explains how and why *IT* became to be regarded as what *it* is. 

EVERYTHING about knowledge development processes must be more open, more transparent ... this includes the code/algorithms/data behind the product, the issues discussions that went into bugs/feature requests, the devstats and commitgraphs, the developers making up the special interest groups working on the product ... we learn from every last piece of how the end product came to be.

If we genuinely care about knowledge, boundless curiosity is essential -- the entire process of knowledge development cannot ever be OPEN or transparent enough ... and transparency with robust curiosty is the going to be best way of obtaining the truth. The process has to be OPEN.

Curating annotated reading lists is not just about reading something, but it is really about ceasely crawling over everything about the process ... we can see the value of this in how the Classics shaped the thinking of generations after generations of people affected by the Classics, ie Shakespear's library and literary influences shape Shakespeare's writing--those plays did not spring from thin air or some sort of drug-induced haze ... but the process of ruminating on topics, finding new information, running the analysis of the data again and everything we do when we are serious about curating such OPEN lists publicly ... helps one to think about the context of what one has read, what it's impact is, whether it applies going forward. 

It's important to do this rumination or curation publicly, transparently ... with OPEN forkable lists building upon the AWESOME pattern of list repositories [as seen on Github]. It is the process of curation that goes beyond immersive reading to help people begin to learn how others learn, to learn how others express ideas, context, meaning.

## The currated annotated reading lists will not include ANY proprietary material

There might be references to things such as papers from peer-reviewed journals with a pay wall ... but that reference will be limited to a discussion of the title, abstract and authors -- the reference will not be ignored, but proprietary materials will not the *suggested* reading list ... and that's not primarily because not everyone can afford to obtain access, but because propriety restrictions restrict FULL discovery of background for knowledge development ... we need full, open, transparent access for anyone OR otherwise, the process of knowledge development is impaired.
