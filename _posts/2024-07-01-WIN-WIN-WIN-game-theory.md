*Of course, we want to make SMART, SHREWD moves ... but if we are really thinking long-term, we want our counterparties to also be SMART and SHREWD in their thinking as they enter into smart contracts with us ... and we also want the large arena of interested participants, temporarily on the sidelines to be SHREWD and SMART ... the best contracts are not those where one side takes advantage of the other OR wishes for disaster to befall one side, but contracts that legimately allocate risk, opportunity and hazard to those best able to bear risk, opportunity and hazard. 

# Toward the WIN-WIN-WIN of shrewd crowdliness


Social impact bonds are all about smart contract enforcement.

Hereâ€™s a comprehensive list of 250 questions designed to help you explore the various dimensions of social impact bonds (SIBs) and their relationship to smart contract enforcement. These questions cover hypothetical scenarios, potential mistakes, strategic nuances, and broader implications. They are organized into thematic categories for ease of use. This list should provide a framework for beginning to explore the complexities of social impact bonds and their intersection with smart contract enforcement ... as we should expect, it will be necessary to dive deeper into specific areas to really understand the nuances of how these things might work, but not until we have at least a superficial understanding of the lay of the land.
