Aim to write an INSANELY useful book for a reader who was at your level before you have learned what you have learned the HARD way ... think of your audience as you, five or ten or twenty years ago ... what can you tell that audience that will get them up to your level of understanding in a tenth or one-hundredth of the time?

Paradoxically, this means that you should begin by writing an impassioned, stream-of-consciousness, extra-shitty no-filters SUPER HONEST first draft ... ABSOLUTELY NO FILTERS.  RAW.  UNEDITED. PURE TANGLED CRAP!!! 

It can suck ... because the first draft is for nothing other than basic wild-ass THINKERING and a chaotic BRAIN DUMP.

If the revision-upon-revision after thousands of levels of revisions ever amount to anything, after a decent final product emerges, the first draft can be THROWN AWAY ... so what if it sucks ... the point is put ideas down and START getting your head wrapped around the project ... the point is to NOT BE PARALYZED by some ridiculous need to type out a first draft of EXCELLENCE ... your draft might somehow be entirely excellent and creatively brilliant beyond words, but it doesn't have to be -- that is NOT the objective of a first draft.

Start working with an outline for your books and steadily IMPROVE your outline as you refine your style. If you want, try starting with a 10-chapter outline format ... make yours better than this; this can be copied to be your starting point for an extra extra-shitty first draft.

# Preface

Write this AFTER the entire book is in final form.

# Grand Introduction

Write this AFTER the other chapters are pretty close to being in final form.

# Getting Started, Reading Lists, Interviews, Acquiring Expertise, Understand Ultimate Root Cause

BEFORE anyone starts doing anything, they really have to LEARN a lot the lay of the land ... they will have to LEARN how to think, what keywords to use, what the basic jargon is -- they need a very basic road map ... they need to be addressed as independent thinkers who are developing their own program of research and study ... it's NOT about mastery, that with comes with time and practice ... this is about giving some clues about where the bodies are buried so that people can get enough background to be dangerous.

# Prioritization, Risk Management, SMART Goal Setting

Of course, it is dangerous, tricky and HARD ... so is life.

# Brainstorm a PDCA Plan for Basic Practice, Building Discipline, Achieving Awareness

# After you think you know what you are doing, LEARN by experimenting in a knowledgable manner

# If it's not broken, break it -- develop a practical and safe 3-step plan for eustress leading to hormesis

# Master the first step, do at least 25 PDCA cycles

# Re-Strategize the second step, then master that step with 25 more PDCA cycles

# From "basecamp" for the final ascent, strategize the third step and master it.

# After mastering the third step, plan to SUSTAIN your gains as you GROW in other realms.

# Appendices, Glossaries, Cheat Sheets, Workbooks, Checklists
