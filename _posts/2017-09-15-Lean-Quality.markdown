LEAN Quality, or the technology of the most efficient, highest possible quality and continuous improvement is one of [my philanthropic venture](http://markbruns.github.io/philanthropy/mvp/opensource/2017/07/15/Venture-Philanthropy.html) areas ... removing waste is about higher quality, lower maintenance, more sublime, more natural existence ... ideally, it is about an independent, creative way of life that costs nothing to maintain. The ideal may be unattainable, but we should work at making living and the maintenance of life rewarding and fun in of themselves.

Learning to see waste is a matter of thinking serious about the eight wastes of the D.O.W.N.T.I.M.E. acronym during our downtime ... we should not think of waste as a crime or moral failure -- instead we should look at it as an opportunity for improvement. Focusing on LEAN quality is a way to polish something that we are justifiable already proud of.  

# Defects

  * Not understanding the requirements, or worse, just doing something before learning the requirements
  * Producing the wrong thing or something that cannot be used without rework or re-conditioning
  * Producing CRAP for a variety of reasons, eg not paying attention or keeping a process under tight control

# Overproduction

  * Producing something that will need to be disposed of [just for the sake of being productive]
  * Producing something because it's easier to keep drones busy and mindless than it is to manage creative people
  * Producing more quantity rather than better quality or more difficult to produce more needed items  

# Waiting

  * Keeping people in limbo, possibly producing defects or overproducing something, while they wait for answer
  * Not being respectful of others time, attention or their urgency but just keeping them waiting out of arrogance
  * Waiting in traffic, in line; waiting for responses; waiting for feedback from a device or process  

# Negativity

  * Having the mindset of a Nihilist, rather than a Realist
  * Not Listening, especially to others, but also to the process or to Nature
  * Not using suggestions or ideas, but instead finding fault with the suggestor

# Transportation

  * All transport of people, products, commodities, liquids, fuel, power, information should be seen as a candidate for being a potential waste that could possibly to be eliminated through more mindful, disciplined consideration of logistics, JIT inventory control and on-site production practices.
  * Transporting things to the wrong place at the wrong time is actually a defect in logisitics.
  * Transport more of something than what is required is actually an overproduction problem because the excess material will have to be disposed of.

# Inventory

  * All inventory should be seen as a candidate for being a potential waste that could possibly to be eliminated through more mindful, disciplined application of tighter inventory control and JIT production practices such as Kanban.
  * Inventory that sits around for even a brief amount of time (ie enough to notice the existence of inventory) will degrade or will need significant amounts of investment (ie a controlled environment warehouse) to keep it in condition and from being stolen or damaged.

# Movement

  * Staying busy or just doing something is either NOT using energy/resources to produce nothing or it is producing the wrong thing or overproducing, ie movement is NOT an indicator of production.
  * Everyone performing a task should standardize on the very most efficient, very least cost, very most reliable form of movement and should competitively work at finding even more efficient, lower cost, more reliable standards.

# Ego

  * We should aim for the most efficient, lowest cost, most reliable operation and take pride in this rather than any cleverness, extra features or fritterware or any other special flourishes which do not improve standard efficiency, lower standard cost or make the standard more reliable.
  * ALL productive work and operational performance that happen primarily for the sake of vanity or showmanship are waste.
  * There is plenty of opportunity to take pride in a flawless execution, a high quality product or a process that is more free from waste than any other similar process.
