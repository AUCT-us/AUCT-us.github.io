# This annotated reading list does not include proprietary packages. 

We learn from living open source knowledge communities ... learning is not exactly about a factoid we come across in Wikipedia entry, but as the community processes of Wikipedia show, we must learn about how communities are learning and what resources those communities are developing. 

As open sourceists, we are concerned with studying and maybe improving open source learning projects. We look at how it works ... how participants read / review / discuss before they fork / revise / refactor / extend.ing open source knowledge ... as more people participate, the lack of any justification for proprietary, closed-source should either become more obvious to everyone OR otherwise, those associated with proprietary materials will have to add something other than the cachet of overcharging. 

Of course, smarter people now realize that the cost to purchase something has nothing to do with its value ... in educational knowledge resources most of the value comes from being involved some small way in something larger, something that ***extends*** open source for others.

# Introduction

Computational linguistics is really about learn how to do machine-assisted or artificially-intelligent reading ... it's really about how to use machine learning, artificial intelligence, crowdsourcing, data APIs and other little skills in the structure of information, ontology and knowledge engineering to accelerate one's speed reading.

To put this another way, everything that learned about reading and learning already is or soon will completely out of date. This is especially true if you are someone who is old, ie past 25 or so ... you are going to need to learn how to learn ... if you think that you know how to learn, you are going to have to break the bad habits of being yourself, unlearn what you thought you knew and then learn how to learn ... and you are going to have to do this for the rest of your life ... because, unless you missed it, we have completely turned a corner in how human communities learn/test/adapt now in crowds AND this human community learning is now also machine-augmented.  

To put this another way ... the language of 2026 will be different from the language of 2021 ... this is not terribly new ... 2021 is definitely NOT 2016; but the pace of change in communication / information / knowledge has increased.  Words might still sound the same and thus trick people into thinking that the same terms/idioms still apply. Now obviously, some things don't really ever change, eg a dozen of eggs is still / probably always will be a very affordable way to obtain grams of protein -- although the dietary impact IS the same, the hysterical nature of the biased, untruthful nutrition reportage has not always been as well recognized  as it is now. 

So if you are in the nursing home, assist living center or some isolated area, you might be tempted to think that nothing has changed, eg "You always like your eggs for breakfast and you were not gonna change because of some hysterical nonsense!" -- except, that kind of thought in itself is proof of your isolation. There's nothing wrong with isolation ... as long as one actually knows what one is isolated from -- which is sorta impossible under complete isolation.

# What we can speak about, we must pass over in silence ... we shouldn't pass over it in ignorance.

It is really a matter of linguistics ... mapping ideas to words or pictures that have the same value to others.  

In the realm of machine-augmented humman learning ... we cannot get too far without talking about the concepts, frameworks, analytical models, philopophical constructs, data and data integrity, machine learning operations, data quality and observability, monitoring, measurement systems analysis, version control systems, distributed open source communities ... learning comes out of how we experience and communicate ideas AND then how we use our shared language for expressing those ideas to formulate new hypotheses and to design the experimental framework which will prove to us that our hypotheses have some validity.

People have always had a huge variety of different reasons for learning new languages but most of the time reason for NEEDING to do so is about "going somewhere" ... and NOW, maybe we want to *go* somewhere virtually, professionally or creatively, not necessarily in meatspace or to a geographic destination like the Grand Canyon or the ruins of ancient Greece ... in order for us to really GET SOMEWHERE in our virtual realm, we must be able to *think somewhat natively* in that NEW language. In my case, it is definitely NOT because I have something to SAY in that new territory ... it is because I want to LISTEN in someone else's native tongue.  

After all, if not for the part about *thinking somewhat natively* or to carry on a reasonably **meaningful** conversation, the utility of simple translators like Wikipedia to explain concepts or translate.google.com for words is a little too handy.  

Why should one bother with a new language if one just wants to babble out the same old crap ... does it matter which language one uses for a banal exchange? If your conversations are just a matter of "Have you tried the new oregano pasta at this restaurant?" OR "Which wine/dessert/cigar do you recommend?" OR some other example of consumption, THEN why bother? If you're not about production, but you just want to taste things -- then just swallow and express different levels of orgasmic pleasure or pain.

Of course, it is not just good, but probably essential, for a any senior citizen, ie someone over 30 or so (Dylan was spot-on correct about generally NEVER trusting people over 30 because most people stop thinking differently or learning new professions in their late twenties), to put one's old subconsious through the trauma and aggravation of learning to think differently in a different language, to reach that point where one finally really *gets it* and thinks conceptually using the constructs of the language. 

But we should understand that this attribute of different thinking in the *new language* could also pertain to something like a new profession OR new set of friends from a new job or hobby OR new set of computer languages and frameworks. 

The IMPORTANT part, for superior cognitive health/fitness and the level of health/fitness to even be able to exercise in the future, is the eustress of thinking radically differently that comes from thinking natively, in the idioms, jargon and common vernacular of an entirely different language.
