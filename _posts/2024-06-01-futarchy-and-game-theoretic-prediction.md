MOST people [include most politicians and staffers] think in terms of a *ceteris paribus* world ... all other things being equal ... what's the effect of this policy change ... they don't see that there will adaptations and counter-adaptations ... and the ceteris paribus world will no longer be remotely applicable to even think about any more [never mind actual Reality] as soon as it's judged likely that the first policy change will probably happen.

# Regulatory complexity is FAR worse than regular complexity

It's not just because of the dimensions of one-ups-man-ship in regulating the other guy and non even just because of how the status quo defends the less efficient ... there's far more to think about.

The following questions explore key aspects of implementing and scaling prediction markets, smart contracts, and futarchic systems while considering technical, economic, and societal implications ... just remember, even the simulated changes to the game have real impacts on the game as soon as their likelihood is taken seriously ... it's important to BEGIN by considering ALL of the questions superficially and then drilling down into each one. You will want to resist the urge to chase any of these down the rabbithole immediately -- after doing economic research and exploration of trading/hedging strategies for over 50 years, I have learned that my mind really need the scope, depth, breadth of 250 questions ponder to get a good START on understanding something well enough to even have the vocabulary down well enough to ask a halfway decent question.
