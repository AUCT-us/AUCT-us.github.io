If you are going to follow the herd, you're going to eat a lot of dust and feel terrified a lot of time for no good reason whatsoever.  There are herds of people intent on following Trump, following the #NeverTrump movement, following Hillary ... all move in lock step with one another and have a variety of ways of whipping other members of the herd into delusional frenzies.  Human beings are much more stupid when they are in herds ... if you believe that there is even a RISK of your being in a herd, you really need to change and be your own person. If YOU don't look out for your integrity, no one else will ... there is nothing wrong with being gregarious, outgoing and friendly ... there are many benefits to things like voluntary standards and respecting the beliefs, customs, conventions and social norms others ... we can certainly learn from others, but **integrity is impossible to achieve through imitation.**

I cannot fathom why the herd imagines that Presidential elections matter ... the population of people that vote for a President matters [because we all must conduct our lives and businesses with those people], but the actual election does not matter.  With the exception of Ronald Reagan [but only, because he was my Commander-In-Chief in 1981-1983, when I was a Federal agent, still deluded by the prospects of a career in public service and his policies thus inordinately, pathologically affected me] no President has actually mattered in terms of how I conduct my life.  I don't expect that the next one will matter either; I almost want to be proven wrong.

The herd definitely WANTS Presidential elections to matter ... because the herd WANTS to be led ... the herd desperately needs to find a leader it can believe it, a leader with integrity ... because no one in the herd can lead or think for themselves, no one in the herd has a shred of integrity -- they have demonstrated time and again that they do not know integrity when integrity slaps them in the face. The want their integrity to go after someone else ... they want a "leader" who will blame *the other*, the immigrant, the jew, the nigger, the irredeemable, deplorable misogynist. The herd cannot and does not want to know.  The herd cannot and does not want to know.

That is why the herd imagines that Presidential elections matter ... the herd cannot adapt, the herd NEEDS a President who will restrict the ability of citizens to be informed, the herd NEEDS a President who will restrict the ability of citizens to defend themselves.  

You don't have to be part of the herd; you can choose to be part of the minority of people who can think for themselves and defend themselves and therefore are not afraid those who share information ... including information on how to produce weapons.

*"There is much more to be hoped for in an excess of information or of weapons than in the restriction of information or arms control."* â€” Jean Baudrillard ... from the epigraph of Cody Wilson's book [Come and Take It: The Gun Printer's Guide to Thinking Free](https://www.amazon.com/Come-Take-Printers-Guide-Thinking-ebook/dp/B01CO34MBI/)
