If you are going to follow the herd, you're going to eat a lot of dust and feel terrified a lot of time for no good reason whatsoever.  There are herds of people intent on following Trump, following the #NeverTrump movement, following Hillary ... all move in lock step with one another and have a variety of ways of whipping other members of the herd into delusional frenzies.  Human beings are much more stupid when they are in herds ... if you believe that there is even a RISK of your being in a herd, you really need to change and be your own person. If YOU don't look out for your integrity, no one else will -- integrity is impossible to achieve through imitation.

I cannot fathom why people imagine that Presidential elections matter ... the population of people that vote for a President matters [because we all must conduct our lives and businesses with those people], but the actual election does not matter.  With the exception of Ronald Reagan [but only, because he was my Commander-In-Chief in 1981-1983, when I was a Federal agent, still deluded by the prospects of a career in public service and his policies thus inordinately, pathologically affected me] no President has actually mattered in terms of how I conduct my life.  I don't expect that the next one will matter either; I almost want to be proven wrong.
