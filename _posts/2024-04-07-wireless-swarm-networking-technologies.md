We've all heard the disarmingly simplistic phrase that, ***"the NETWORK is the computer"*** ... which actually means something that is a bit unsettling and still mindblowing to contemplate, particularly as we think of the rate of addition of smart devices to the **NETWORK**. The global internetworked super **NETWORK** of all hive-minded internetwork of networks ... nevermind that small proportion of computational devices and things like PLCs might be unreachable from the **NETWORK**, you don't really need that teensy amount of additional computational power compared to what the **NETWORK** already provides ... actually becomes your computer as you become capable of thinking in terms of the [super] **NETWORK** paradigm ... and this is NOT about botnets or viruses or malware or any of the other things that might be associated with darker side of networking -- the **NETWORK** is about the *aggregate* ***crowdliness*** of people knowingly, securely using their devices without having their computation cycles stolen from them or having their privacy intruded upon in any way.

For all of us, even the most compute-savvy of us, it's not so much what that NETWORK might be able to do or cannot do ...the main constraints are in the limits of our imagination and understanding of how to ***practically*** *compute* with the NETWORK in all of its ***crowdly*** magnificence. As we contemplate the significance of that phrase that, ***"the NETWORK is the computer"*** ... we ***begin*** to realize that the possibilities would be nothing short of amazing as we gained experience from the exploration of even a teensy subset of the computational power, eg, a swarm of autonomous swarm robotic edge devices.  Fewer devices can be a more directly configurable an more responsive as a multi-node, but more finite **network** of a computer. The key to practically realizing that capability is in the realm of wireless swarm networking technologies which enable the separate devices to "think as one.*

In this post, we discuss our development [scoping our focus as we use the Claude 3 Opus AI assistant] of a 30-module syllabus for developing a background understanding of wireless swarm networking technologies. Each module of this syllabus includes a deeper diver into the the module's focus using mix of lectures, research paper discussions, hands-on projects, and case studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of wireless swarm networking and its applications. Adapting this this syllabus allows us to think through the topic in detail, but doing it in a manner that might emphasize the areas that can most practically explored in a manner that is relevant to our research interests.

Our study of wireless swarm networking technologies will focus on Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), Swarm Intelligence Protocols such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as well as closely-related topics in wireless swarm networking with applications Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, disaster response, military communications, environmental monitoring and agricultural remote sensing. We will attempt to cover the challenges associated with wireless swarm networking in greater depth, such as limited bandwidth, energy constraints, security, interoperability and those more specific areas which require further research and development efforts.
