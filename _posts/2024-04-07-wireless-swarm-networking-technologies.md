We've all heard the phrase that, *"the NETWORK is the computer"* which means that the global internetwork can becomes your computer as you become capable of thinking in terms of what globally interconnected processing and information networks can do and can't do ... but most of the constraints are in terms of what you can imagine; it's just necessary to understand something about the emergent capabilities of the internetworked computing devices.  

Well, as we contemplate the significance of that phrase, we realize that it would also be true that a swarm of autonomous swarm edge devices can be a more directly configurable, more responsive computer ... the key to realizing that capability in in the realm of wireless swarm networking technologies which enable the separate devices to "think as one.*

In this post, we discuss our development [scoping our focus as we use the Claude 3 Opus AI assistant] of a 25-module syllabus for developing a background understanding of wireless swarm networking technologies. Each module of this syllabus includes a deeper diver into the the module's focus using mix of lectures, research paper discussions, hands-on projects, and case studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of wireless swarm networking and its applications. Adapting this this syllabus allows us to think through the topic in detail, but doing it in a manner that might emphasize the areas that can most practically explored in a manner that is relevant to our research interests.

Our study of wireless swarm networking technologies will focus on Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), Swarm Intelligence Protocols such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as well as closely-related topics in wireless swarm networking with applications Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, disaster response, military communications, environmental monitoring and agricultural remote sensing. We will attempt to cover the challenges associated with wireless swarm networking in greater depth, such as limited bandwidth, energy constraints, security, interoperability and those more specific areas which require further research and development efforts.
