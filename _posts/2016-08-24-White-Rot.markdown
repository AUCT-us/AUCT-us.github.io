Understanding herbicide transformation is necessary for pesticide development for their safe and efficient use, as well as for developing pesticide bioremediation strategies for contaminated soil and water. Recent studies persuasively demonstrated the key role of soil white-rot fungi in biotransformation of various anthropogenic environmental contaminants. However, often this common knowledge is not associated with specific metabolic processes of fungi and therefore cannot be transformed into specific recommendations for agricultural practice.  Beyond just bioremediation of pollutants, think about how much more we don't know about building and conditioning of soils for optimal productivity?  If we are so smart about soils, what stops us from making it possible for everyone to be surrounded by a luxurious garden and living foodscape?  The answer is that we are most decidedly NOT THAT SMART when it comes to soils and everything that soils could offer us.  

Of course oceans are very important, but since most humans live on land, human life is almost entirely based on what soil ecosystems -- I have no problem whatsoever with people disagreeing with me on the importance of soils, as long as they back up their argument with actions and agree to move PERMANENTLY offshore.  Soil should be the most important topic for humans to be knowledgable about.  Many people [erroneously] believe that the largest problem facing humanity involves carbon in the atmosphere ... whether this is a concern or not, these people seem to completely ignore that 2,700 Gt of C stored in soils worldwide.  As almost all knowledgable gardeners or farmers would tell you, they would like to have more ... MUCH more ... organic material in their soil.  As anyone who loves growing things, anyone who loves having dirt under their fingernails, knows and there is a capacity to double, triple or quadruple the soil organic carbon in most soils under cultivation or in human use.  This is significant because there is only 780 Gt of C is in the atmosphere and a small percentage of humans believe that it should be three-quarters of that amount ... 200 Gt of C is less than one-tenth of C stored in C-deficient soils worldwide. Even if we assume that world's oceans cannot be managed as a carbon sink [which is slightly debatable, but perhaps true because of property rights issues] it becomes clear that carbon "problem" should be thought of as a soil issue. We can do a much better job of utilizing our soils for a variety of different issues -- better knowledge of soils not only solves the carbon  issue, adding soil organic carbon will improve soil quality and productivity.  

The OTHER issue with soil ecosystems involves essential compounds like antibiotics that originated from studies of soils.  People fail to realize how fundamentally these discoveries have transformed human existence ... the real problem with this fundamental ignorance is the lack of understanding that we have only just scratched the surface.  We do not understand a tenth or even one-percent of what soil ecosystems have to offer ... we do not even understand enough to know how small the fraction of that one-percent is.  

As an example of how incomplete our knowledge is, consider how soil has, for millions of years, provides the environment for many different fungal species. These different species play an absolutely role in recycling nutrients through decay and breaking down of materials. Of course, these fungi produce different compounds [many essential for other species] in their digestive process but they do not just recycle nutrients by digest decaying plant matter. Fungi are attacked by bacteria which favor the same growing conditions and food stocks, but molds have defense mechanisms such as antimicrobial agents that prevent of the bacteria from making new cell walls and reproducing ... as Penicillium chrysogenum ... the ability of P. chrysogenum to produce antimicrobial agent penicillin appears to have evolved over hundreds of thousands or millions of years in soils in damp, consistent temperature environments in temperate and subtropical regions [which also favor bacterial growth]. Even though most humans now take penicillin for granted ... few know that the sexual stage of P. chrysogenum was discovered only a few years ago, in 2013, by mating cultures in the dark on oatmeal agar supplemented with biotin, after the mating types (MAT1-1 or MAT1-2) of the strains had been determined using [PCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction) amplification ... the tools and technologies to do meaningful things are still being invented, as we stumble into things that we can't "see" yet ...  so we really don't even know that much at all yet about how we would begin to set up practical methods to select and breed what has been one of the most important fungi to human beings ... but others species, with uses we haven't really discovered or conceived of yet, are almost necessarily more important.  

When one considers that approximately 70,000 fungal species have been described, but the total number of fungal species is estimated to be well over 1.5 million and then one begins to understand that human beings have only begun to select and breed a very limited number of these fungal species for specific compounds and uses ... when we factor in the chemical, bacterial, plant and animal interactions inside our soil ecosystems ... it becomes almost painfully clear that our knowledge of soil ecosystems is teensy, especially in comparison to the human-scale crops and livestock that humans developed and perfected for over ten thousand years before even understanding that things like bacteria and fungi existed. Part of the lack of understanding is scale -- in order to really understand micro interactions, it's necessary to be able to observe at the nano scale. But it's also matter of understanding ecosystem complexities, co-evolution and inventing new approaches, eg, [PCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction), [metagenomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics), to explore how and why the microbial world of soil ecosystems works the way it does.
