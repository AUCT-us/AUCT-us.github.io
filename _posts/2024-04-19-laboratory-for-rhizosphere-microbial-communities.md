In order to study the microbial communities in the rhizosphere and their impact on soil quality properties, we will need to ***think*** about how we would build the laboratory in order to accomplish the study of those living ecosystems.

Ideally, most of us tend to do our best thinking when our hands are dirty from digging in the soil of our own gardens ... because actually *thinking* about living ecoystems does not usually happen at the time we are too focused on trying to understand the published work in scientific literature OR when we are analyzing transcriptomics data ... it happens when we go for walks or when we garden.

Setting up our soil quality laboratory has to come out of our thinking processes ... it's a measure 15X or 37X or 82X, cut ONCE process ... we need to GET OUR THINKING right before we get out the milling machine and start milling some stainless fixture or doo-dad we need for our laboratory. We have to THINK first, and RETHINK and THINK a lot more, then when we're really sure, then we can spend the $ and give stuff a try.

Humans do become not adults UNTIL AFTER an individual finally realizes that, in any problem in life, NOBODY is coming to save that individuals.  We have to do things ourselves OR hire professionals AFTER we understand what capabilities we need from the professional. We should never just have faith in professionals, because we are totally helpless and can't figure it out.

**Unless we are still children, we have to save ourselves** ... and even when we hire professionals to build laboratories for us, we had better KNOW why the professional can accomplish what we need the laboratory to accomplish. If we don't understand what is necessary to be known -- we are better off never having access to a laboratory which will never really give us anything informative and might kill us. 

Nobody is going to set up the laboratory for us ... it does not make sense whatsoever to take samples and bring samples of living things to the laboratory -- if we disturb the living ecosystem, we no long can study it ... we killed it. **LIFE must be examined in it's LIVING form.**

The KEY THING TO UNDERSTAND FIRST is ... **it is necessary for the study of a living ecoystem to be done with the intact living ecosystem IN THE FIELD.**  

Neither the laboratory nor our methods for studying the living ecosystem can learn anything from the study of DEAD, inert chemical molecules ... the laboratory for the study of microbial communities in the rhizophere can kill the life without *moral* repurcussions, but it cannot kill the life without destroying the living knowledge that is embodied in situ in the rhizosphere. Practically, we will need to disturb the rhizophere by the presence of our study, but we should take ever step to MINIMIZE the disturbance.

WE have to THINK about about how we would go about studying microbial communities in the rhizosphere ... so, of course, understanding something about what are studying is essential to designing the laborotory to study it. 

That's why this laboratory course MUST cover a wide range of topics related to soil microbiology, NOT JUST sampling techniques or soil physical and chemical properties, but we currently think we understand about microbial diversity and plant-microbe interactions. It will include hands-on training in various laboratory tools, instruments, software, and methods for investigating microbial communities in the rhizosphere ... but MOSTLY it has to understand the living ecosystem that we are studying.

It is extremely easy now to develop, extend and expand upon things like deep dives into each module of a comprehensive 200-module syllabus for studying the laboratory tools, instruments, software, and methods to investigate the functional and taxonomic diversity of rhizosphere microbial communities and their impact on soil quality properties.  

The syllabus might start out looking something like the following ... except that students should be encouraged to constantly update and improve upon the syllabus as the body of knowledge that they are studying evolves according to new technologies and methods discussed in the literature.

1. **Introduction** to the [rhizosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizosphere) and its ***importance*** [not so much focused on the *importance* of everything that the region of soil covering the arable land on Earth ***produces*** for humans OR the *importance* of everthing directly influenced by root secretions and associated soil microorganisms produces for other living organisms on the planet, but] for our ***introductory*** understanding of a practical example of a [microbiome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiome) that we can study and interrogate with the kinds of labratory instruments and processes as well as analytical methods of the data we gather. This ***introduction*** to should mainly get us ***part of the way*** *to an appreciation for how little we actually know* ... in our understanding of topics that relate to those microbial bacterial communities such as the kinds of sub-topics associated with those ecosystems such as [physiochemical gradients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry) and [cellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)) [signalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling) by [prokaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote) and [eukaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote) OR living things such as [mycorrhizal fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal_fungi) as well as [parasitic nematodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode#Parasitic_species) and [plant viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_virus).

The main ASSIGNMENT for this **Introduction** is to spend several hours or so drilling down through Wikipedia links, further drilling down into [topics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/) like ["soil microbiology"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/soil-microbiology) or []"rhizosphere"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/rhizosphere) in the [recent scientific literature](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics), asking questions of [our favorite AI assistant](https://claude.ai/chat/) or [our second-favorite AI assistant](https://gemini.google.com/app) for context; we need to generally [explore the scientific literatue](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) and that includes [exploring visual graphs of connections](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) as we learn about the *lay of the land* for our syllabus and general program of focused study as we BEGIN to **develop and refine the rest of the syllabus for this course.** In other words, the meta-purpose of an INTRODUCTIION in any sort of autodidactic program of study is to start getting used to the process of always looking ahead at what we will be studying and using that plan **re-factor, re-develop and customize the rest of the syllabus in light of what we have learned.**.  If it's not already clear, the objective of the assignment is to ***immerse*** our minds in the process of engineering our own future knowledge graph, always re-factoring and re-calibrating the priorties of study the rest of the syllabus in light of what we know so far and have learned today. As we go forward, new technologies and methods will come to light and we will need to be able to adapt our own knowledge engineeing process by exploiting those new technologies and methods.
