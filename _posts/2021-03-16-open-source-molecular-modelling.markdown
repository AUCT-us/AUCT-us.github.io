[Orac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orac_(MD_program)) ... initial release 1990


[GROMACS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GROMACS) ... initial release 1991	

[Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(software)) ... initial release 1999	

[CP2K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP2K) ... initial release 2000	


[Avogadro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_(software)) ... initial release 2008	


[NWChem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NWChem) ... an ab initio computational chemistry software package which includes quantum chemical and molecular dynamics functionality. NWChem was actually designed to run on high-performance parallel supercomputers as well as conventional workstation clusters ... with an aim of being scalable both in its ability to treat large problems efficiently, and in its usage of available parallel computing resources.

[MDynaMix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDynaMix) ... for general purpose molecular dynamics to simulate mixtures of molecules, interacting by AMBER- and CHARMM-like force fields in periodic boundary conditions. Algorithms are included for NVE, NVT, NPT, anisotropic NPT ensembles, and Ewald summation to treat electrostatic interactions. The code was written in a mix of Fortran 77 and 90 (with Message Passing Interface (MPI) for parallel execution). 

[Ascalaph Designer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascalaph_Designer) ...  is a grpahical environment for common programs of quantum and classical molecular modelling ... such as the open source tools [NWChem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NWChem) OR [MDynaMix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDynaMix) OR CP2K[CP2K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP2K) ... as well as the free [for educational use], but proprietary closed-source tools like [ORCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORCA_(quantum_chemistry_program)) OR[Firefly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(computer_program)).
