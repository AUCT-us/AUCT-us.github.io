Most people believe in government in the same way that four-year-olds believe in Santa Claus.  They believe because the rest of the human species has lied to them and it has never occurred to them that they had a choice in questioning their belief in government.  So governments persist ... for the same reason that any group of four-year-olds will persist in their belief in Santa Claus -- nothing will derail that that belief, because the four-year-olds WANT to believe in Santa ... governments persist because people DESPERATELY, HOPELESSLY, UNFAILINGLY need to believe in governments [because deep down, they're all little kids who still really WANT to believe in Santa].

Governments have ALWAYS existed to protect the interests of already powerful, wealthy and general affluence who want to preserve their power and wealth ... there's nothing especially dark or conspiratorial going here -- government is MOSTLY just a matter of preserving the rules of the game, eg the currency in your wallet can be spent; if you buy a car, you get title to the car to prove you own it ... but we should remember that the already powerful have the inside track on preserving and EXPANDING their power.

So what does technology have to do with it?  Technology is inherently DISRUPTIVE of power ... even though powerful and wealthy citizens are good at investing in [and sometimes subverting] technologies.

But technology can also disrupt the inefficiencies that the powerful exploit to control government. Government does not have to be inefficient ... even if the gross inefficiency of government will probably be what ultimately brings about the mass annihilation of all humans and other lifeforms.

Government does not have to be coercive ... believe it or not, instead of broadcasting propaganda to the masses, a government could actually LISTEN to what individual human beings want in order to boost the efficiency of government.
