Most people believe in government in the same way that four-year-olds believe in Santa Claus.  They believe because the rest of the human species has lied to them and it has never occurred to them that they had a choice in questioning their belief in government.  So governments persist ... for the same reason that any group of four-year-olds will persist in their belief in Santa Claus -- nothing will derail that that belief, because the four-year-olds WANT to believe in Santa ... governments persist because people DESPERATELY, HOPELESSLY, UNFAILINGLY need to believe in governments [because deep down, they're all little kids who still really WANT to believe in Santa].

Governments have ALWAYS existed to protect the interests of powerful people ... powerful people use media, propaganda, moral suasion, expert liars and every last trick in the book to tell ALL people that government is a social contract protecting ALL people ... that is a LIE.  Governments protect powerful people and even powerful people don't want the bullshit that comes with being a tyrant 24x7.
