Most people believe in government in the same way that four-year-olds believe in Santa Claus.  They believe because the rest of the human species has lied to them and it has never occurred to them that they had a choice in questioning their belief in government.  So governments persist ... for the same reason that any group of four-year-olds will persist in their belief in Santa Claus -- nothing will derail that that belief, because the four-year-olds WANT to believe in Santa ... governments persist because people DESPERATELY, HOPELESSLY, UNFAILINGLY need to believe in governments [because deep down, they're all little kids who still really WANT to believe in Santa].

Governments have ALWAYS existed to protect the interests of powerful people ... powerful people use media, propaganda, moral suasion, expert liars and every last trick in the book to tell ALL people that government is a social contract protecting ALL people ... that is a LIE.  Governments protect powerful people and even powerful people don't want the bullshit that comes with being a tyrant 24x7. This is NOT something that can ever be changed -- the human species will be extinct BEFORE powerful people stop using ruses like government to control and manipulate other human beings.  That is the way it is ... Death and extinction are certain, but until then we will have governments coercively using their monopoly on violence to control human beings and collect taxes from them in order to pay for those doing the control.  Right or wrong -- the existence of government will be a CERTAINTY until human beings are extinct.  

So what does technology have to do with it?  

Government does not have to be inefficient ... even if the gross inefficiency of government will probably be what ultimately brings about the mass annihilation of all humans and other lifeforms.

Government does not have to be coercive ... believe it or not, instead of broadcasting propaganda to the masses, a government could actually LISTEN to what individual human beings want in order to boost the efficiency of government.
