## Assume that we are AT WAR ... in an *information war* sense of being AT war.

It's the best starting assumption until you can prove otherwise ... when the ground beneath you is shifting, you need to develop your *sea legs* ... balance is a matter of constant adjustment and adjusting the bouyancy of adjustment ... conversely, needing to trust something solid is for calcified fossils.

The best working assumption about the content that you come across is that it is supplied by your enemy.  Sure, that might too paranoid, but it is best to be fiercely skeptical ... and that includes being skeptical of your own thoughts and working assumptions.

Most of the *active measures* or *disinformation* in the information war will be about getting you to LIKE some celebrity or figure that you have not met ... there's way more to the disinformation arsensal than just getting you to trust an avatar, but it's kind of safe to say that *MOST* disinformation begins with misplaced faith which starts with inappropriate *like*age of celebrities or commentators. 

### You sorta HAVE TO avoid regular consumption of the news or news commentary.

Mental mastery is a matter of introspective inquiry ... you can think of second-guessing your thoughts as *WRESTLING with the angel of the Lord ... and generally getting BEATEN over and over again.* In order to really THINK, you will need scribble notes in your own journal or write your own blog or keep a journal ... you really need have some sort of mechanism for getting your thoughts into some form that allows for you going back later and reconstructing your thought process.

*If, instead of doing this, you seek the comfort of regular programming, especially when you feel that pscyhological TUG of the comfort of being reinforced with the knowledge of what _JohnQCommentator_'s take on the news is today or this week, well ...* 

***CONGRATULATIONS! If you need your daily dose of some content, then YOU are OFFICIALLY addicted, you are programmed.***

Moreover, if you feel offended by this and say to yourself something like "*That's bullshit! I'm not addicted just because I want a little mental comfort ...*" ... well, guess what, if you feel offended or irritated by something that you know is true, then you have become weaponinized poision to yourself ... and all of the people around you. 

*That's just the way LACK OF mental self-control works, ie that's why we as Christian warriors have pray to forgive others ... we don't need to be forgiven by others; it does not matter if someone hate us, haters are gonna hate us and should hate us -- what we, as Christian warriors REALLY NEED is to be granted, by the grace of our Creator, the ability to forgive, to let go, to move on ... this power is ENTIRELY about mental self-control. I did not make up the rules*...***THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT WORKS.***

The POINT of FIERCE SKEPTICISM ... and the point of resisting the comfort of listening to, reading or watching your daily programming ... like the point of the essentiality of being able to forgive, without worrying about or expecting reciprocal forgiveness ... all of those points are about being in control OF YOUR OWN MIND.


# Why the OPENNESS of OPEN SOURCE content is important


I develop and write my OPEN SOURCE material ... in an open manner with the full commit trail available ... in order to come back to this content ... to edit, revise, remove ... it's about the process of perfecting.

Other people can reconstruct it or backtrack to understand the develop by looking at the commits.

The sources of what I'm working on are never perfect ... that's WHY the sources of open source content are in a repository on GitHub. The public nature of open source repositories is to allow for the possibility of someone else finding the development process as well as the work-in-process source useful.

The whole point of open source is we CAN look at the DEVELOPMENT what's driving whatever on the surface ... always being FIERCELY skeptical of what's behind the scenes.

We should be EVEN MORE FIERCELY SKEPTICAL when something is proprietary, polished, and presented as PERFECT product that some trusted authority or celebrity stands behind ... when we can't see and reconstruct the sources, we cannot trust shit on the surface at all.
