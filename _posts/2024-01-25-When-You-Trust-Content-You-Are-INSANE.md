If there's news or any kind of political content that you *imagine* that you need to listen to on daily basis ... if you feel that pscyhological TUG of wanting to know what _______'s take on the news is today or this week, then YOU are programmed ... if you feel offended by this and you are ready to stop listening to me *because I don't fit any boxes that you need to shove people into* ... then you are FUNCTIONALLY INSANE and a form of weaponinized poision on all of the people around you.

# Trust NO ONE ... including the guy in the mirror

Yes, of course, that has to apply to me.  You should not trust me. I don't trust me.  

I come back to this content ... to edit, revise, remove ... because it's never perfect; I am in the process of perfecting it -- but I would NEVER NEVER NEVER trust me ... and I trust everyone else EVEN LESS than I trust me.

The point is to be FIERCELY skeptical ... and, if you have a favorite new program or favor commentator that you need to listen to every day ... it's not JUST you are not skeptical enough ... it's that you feel that emotional tug which prevents you from being skeptical [ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE STUPID ENOUGH TO THINK THE RULES DON'T APPLY TO YOU] ... so you are functionally insane and you have let yourself become a weaponized tool.

You HAVE TO try to be aware of your own little emotional tugs, psychological pulls ... and not get defensive when someone points out that you have let yourself become a tool ... the whole point is self-awareness and self-correction is that there's just no substitute for being fiercely skeptical of everything and everyone ... and that HAS TO extend to the guy in the mirror, or you have become worse than POISON to everyone around you, especially if you cultivate a group of scychophatic gossips who defend you.

FIERCE skepticism of your own thoughts and feelings is the ONLY path to humilty ... without that, you are a weaponized tool of the worst kind.
