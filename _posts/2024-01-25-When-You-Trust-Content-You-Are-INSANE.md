If there's news or any kind of political content that you *imagine* that you need to listen to on daily basis ... if you feel that pscyhological TUG of wanting to know what _______'s take on the news is today or this week, then YOU are programmed ... if you feel offended by this and you are ready to stop listening to me *because I don't fit any boxes that you need to shove people into* ... then you are FUNCTIONALLY INSANE and a form of weaponinized poision on all of the people around you.
