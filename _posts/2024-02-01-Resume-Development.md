I [asked Bard to develop a resume TEMPLATE for me](https://g.co/bard/share/8a05e2400b69) ... and Bard was EXCELLENT for getting an outline for getting me started ... but as I worked on filling in the blanks of that outline, I rapidly saw that my original question was not really sufficient, so I kept asking questions ... it was really a matter of refining MY thinking and better understanding what questions I really wanted to ask. As I worked on this, I realized that I was really starting to understand my own goals and by asking questions of Bard, I was starting to get a much clearer, more concrete, understandable [for me] idea about precisely what I was looking for ini my job search ... *The biggest value of an AI assistant like Bard is to help someone get better at asking better questions.*

***I understood that I had been approaching job search COMPLETELY WRONG for my entire career.***

A big part of the problem, is that I had looked at the jobs that were available ... at an early point in my life, I looked at the jobs that were available within driving distance ... then I looked at jobs that I could get from my college recruiter or the local city's help wanted ads ... later I looked more broadly at job boards like Indeed ... and I tended to give up and accept what a headhunter offered me.

I could NEVER find my ideal job ... because I had settled for what I thought was available ... I settled because I had not bothered to REALLY, REALLY, REALLY refine my goals and objectives ... **I had settled for the ideas of what total dumbfucks were offering me.**

*I had become the dumbfuck who settled for the best available option.*  I did not CREATE my options. I DID Not Understand MY Own Job Search
