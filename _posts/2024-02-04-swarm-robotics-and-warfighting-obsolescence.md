There is no substitute for being fiercely skeptical, but yet aware enough of technological developments and familar with how they might be implemented so that one can defend oneself. In keeping with the distributed defense philosophical underpinnings of the 2nd Amendment of the US Constitutions, it is quite necessary for citizens to explore the implications of this new technology and its potential impact on the future of warfighting and self-defense in the event of civil wars and insurrections. The best way to PREVENT war from happening is to prepare for its inevitable reality. 

That is why we continue to delve into the topics like RTOS, distributed data and communication methods and self-organizing hierarchies ... in order to lay the groundwork for our future understanding of swarm robotics.

For example, we can start thinking about self-organizing, but independent autonomous robots by reviewing materials on [Self-organizing Nervous Systems (SoNS) of n-multiple independent robots for coordinated swarm robotics](https://browse.arxiv.org/abs/2401.13103). {*NOTE: Please be advised that the [full pdf for this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13103.pdf) is quite large and will take longer than most*}.  If you are interested in this material and the level of development in this field, it also a good idea, in order to have some understanding of the PUBLICLY AVAILABLE pre-print knowledge, to keep up [daily] with new developments in [Arxiv's most recent Computer Science:Robotics preprints](https://browse.arxiv.org/list/cs.RO/recent). 

***Obviously, we should not expect ALL of the current knowledge to immediately show up on Arxiv! It's just that Arxiv does us as provide ordinary members of the public around the world with a LAGGING indication of the level of development in knowledge that is happening in this particular discipline of tech development.***  

The point of this is that warfighting systems dependent upon tanks, motorized artillery and different automotive warfighting systems which were useful a decade ago have become rapidly become increasingly obsolete as new tech-enabled warfighting strategies have been proven effective ... especially, based on what the world has seen in the last couple years.  The warfighting methods of 2014 are now BADLY DATED ... because things like the technological developments such as Self-Organizing Nervous Systems (SoNS) we see in swarm robotics nowadays have made multi-hundred or multi-thousand drone [self-organizing] coordinated swarm technology a battlefield reality.  **Weapon systems that worked in Afghanistan or Iraq wars of the 2000s and 2010s are now obsolete; weapons systems that were used in the 1990s are not DANGEROUSLY obsolete.  IT IS TIME TO DISPOSE OF THE INVENTORIES OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES WHILE THEY STILL ARE VALUED.**
