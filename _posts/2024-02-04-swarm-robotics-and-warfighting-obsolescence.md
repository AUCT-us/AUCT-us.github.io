Warfighting systems dependent upon tanks, motorized artillery and different automotive warfighting systems have become increasingly obsolete, especially after being proven so in the last couple years, because of things like Self-Organizing Nervous Systems (SoNS) of new swarm robotics and multi-drone [self-organizing] coordinated swarm technology.

In keeping with the distributed defense philosophical underpinnings of the 2nd Amendment of the US Constitutions, it is necessary for citizens to explore the implications of this new technology and its potential impact on the future of warfighting and self-defense in the event of civil wars and insurrections.

The best way to PREVENT war from happening is to prepare for its inevitable reality

Self-organized hierarchy is a key unsolved challenge for the future of swarm robotics

We can start thinking about this by reviewing materials on [Self-organizing Nervous System (SoNS) of n-multiple independent robots for coordinated swarm robotics](https://browse.arxiv.org/abs/2401.13103).
