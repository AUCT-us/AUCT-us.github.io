Warfighting systems dependent upon tanks, motorized artillery and different automotive warfighting systems have become increasingly obsolete, especially after being proven so in the last couple years, because of things like Self-Organizing Nervous Systems (SoNS) of new swarm robotics and multi-drone [self-organizing] coordinated swarm technology.

In keeping with the distributed defense philosophical underpinnings of the 2nd Amendment of the US Constitutions, it is necessary for citizens to explore the implications of this new technology and its potential impact on the future of warfighting and self-defense in the event of civil wars and insurrections.

The best way to PREVENT war from happening is to prepare for its inevitable reality. That's why we delve into the topics of RTOS and self-organized hierarchies in order to lay the groundworkd for future of swarm robotics. We can start thinking about self-organizing, but independent autonomous robots by reviewing materials on [Self-organizing Nervous Systems (SoNS) of n-multiple independent robots for coordinated swarm robotics](https://browse.arxiv.org/list/cs.RO/recent). {*NOTE: The [full pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13103.pdf) is quite large and can take awhile*}.  

If you are interested in this material and the level of development in this field, it also a good idea, in order to have some understanding of the PUBLICLY AVAILABLE pre-print knowledge, to keep up [daily] with new developments in [Arxiv's most recent Computer Science:Robotics preprints](https://browse.arxiv.org/list/cs.RO/recent) ... ***obviously, we should not expect ALL knowledge to immediately show up on Arxiv, but this does provide a LAGGING indication of the level of development in knowledge that is happening in the world. ***
