I have been watching and re-watching [Niall Ferguson's series on the six killer apps of Western Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization:_Is_the_West_History%3F). As I have been watching this program, I have also been thinking and reading supporting historical materials with an eye to understanding the demise of different empires and I am almost dumbfounded by the degree to which most people in great empires have always tended to forget the importance of their empire's foundations, what made them great in the first place.  Thus, I completely agree with the whole premise of the show and highly recommend that others watch and re-watch the series.  

We cannot know if the number of "killer apps" is exactly six or the degree to which these "apps" are interrelated and basically share other deeper dependencies, but six killer apps is probably a good way for framing the discussion.  I believe that we should emphasize some things about those apps differently -- the show [like any show broadcast for popular consumption] was constructed [or watered down] TO BE POPULAR and thus avoid any controversy or appearance of toughness or antifragility that would cause people to dismiss the entire show or even question the BBC, Ferguson and those funding the production of the show.  

Fortunately, I don't face the same "lowest-common-denominator" constraint that Ferguson and the BBC did in 2011, so I can state that the six killer apps that made western civilization more antifragile, thus likely to gain from the disorder of history are: 1) intense competition [as a substitute for war], 2) the scientific method and widespread practical research, especially outside of academia, 3) property rights and the Constitutional rule of law [providing the foundation for economic/cultural mobility within the republic and the world], 4) evidence-based health, awareness of fitness [for greater productivity and discipline by key individuals] and medical technology, 5) free markets providing creative destruction of less efficient businesses and diverse alternatives for consumers and employees, 6) freedom of religious or philosophical thought [which underpins the motivation for things like a strong work ethic].  

I now OPTIMISTICALLY believe that some sort of really serious breakdown in the American government is almost certain and that something like even civil war [or at least a declaration of martial law, suspension of Constitutional rights] is likely. I am optimistic because I believe that disruption and chaos can be extremely transformative opportunities for human growth. That absolutely does NOT mean that they are easy; it means than disruption and growth is far, far better than stagnation and drudgery. We are heading into very interesting times; these times will not be one bit easy at all; people will suffer and die and wish for less interesting times BUT tough times are necessary to shed weakness, lay the foundation for future post-traumatic growth. There are those who will believe with their full hearts and souls that these times are "end times" but WE humans do not get to decide when THE END is ... it is far more likely that these are simply extremely difficult times that will push us and everything about our human institutions harder than we can imagine.

The human species can endure far more than any human would ever want to because humans are antifragile.
