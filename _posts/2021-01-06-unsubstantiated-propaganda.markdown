# The only valid, sustainable response is to IGNORE the shitstorm ... not just the NY Times, but avoid the entire climate and atmosphere producing all shitstorms and responses to shitstorms ... from ALL news organizations.

If you are still operating in that field ... re-trace your steps somehow and exit the landmine NOW ... stop participating and lending ANY credence whatsover to the profession.

If it were not clear enough before, we are in the middle of an information nuclear war or thermonuclear meltdown ... ALL news reporting by ALL news organizations is fully weaponized and devoid of any legitimate content, execpt in the meta-sense, eg serving as an indication of the depravity of the journo or news organization dishing up the radioactive poison.  

If you are still operating in that field ... re-trace your steps somehow and exit the landmine NOW ... stop participating and lending ANY credence whatsover to the profession.

# ICYMI ... the "reporting" by ANYONE on January 6th was NOT reporting

BLATANT propagandization of the main stream media continues to break into brand new areas of complete disgustingness ... if there was any doubt that reporting is so blatantly propagandized that it should be criminal, in terms of the betrayal of public trust, EXCEPT that it is something that we cannot, under the 1st Amendment and rights to utter disgusting, worthless, hateful nonsense ... but we can just turn ALL of it off. 

Turning it ALL off means ... EVERY last item produced by journo/commentator working for pay by anything but a LOCAL news organization, ie the kind that print the local Sheriff's arrests/traffic tickets and official legal notices from municipal and county governments ... don't worry about missing anything, because the public is still so driven by the weaponized schlock that national/international news orgs produced that members of the public can't stop themselves from regurgitating the nonsense.

Here's an example ...on January 6, 2021 ... a day of extreme propagandization from all sides ... in what has to represent [thus far] an unprecedented and an absolutely brazen and criminal flurry of unsubstantiated propaganda and misinformation and outright lies, the New York Times claimed, BASED ON UNNAMED SOURCES, that UNKNOWN parties MIGHT HAVE embedded malware in JetBrains software which might have made the [SolarWinds hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach) and other widespread security compromises more possible ... HOW is this even news to NY Times readers? If there's any merit to it whatsoever, something like this not news to information security professionals ... HINT: Except for idiots, nobody trusts their dev toolchain; professionals build checks into their processes and then, several others, do othogonal independent checks on the checks that people have put in place. Why was it necessary for the NYTimes editors to serve up this radioactive waste with other unfounded assertions on January 6th? Of course, we all KNOW what the answer is.
