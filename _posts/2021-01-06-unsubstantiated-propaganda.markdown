On January 6, 2021 ... in an absolutely brazen and criminal flurry of unsubstantiated propaganda and misinformation and outright lies, the New York Times claimed, BASED ON UNNAMED SOURCES, that UNKNOWN parties MIGHT HAVE embedded malware in JetBrains' software that led to the [SolarWinds hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach) and other widespread security compromises.

The WORST of the WORST, yellowest of all yellowey yellow gossip rags ever in the history of prostitution/journalism could begin to make  something more outrageous than this up ... many of us expect this utter swill out of the NY Times now, but the smear campaign against Jetbrains was probably orchestrated by IDIOTS working for Microsoft public relations ... and, it does send a signal that we should trust Microsoft less than ever ... with its hazy probable accusation of a unsubstantieated claim by unnamed sources is nothing other than an advertisement FOR JetBrains IDEs and against VSCode, Github and the rest of Microsoft.
