I don't believe much in polls anymore ... it's not just that the polling data is limited to the people who are in the phone database of the pollsters; most people really HATE to be polled and accordingly have all kinds of incentives for telling pollsters everything other than the truth just so that the pollster will leave them alone.  The big reason that I detest polls is the euphoric over-reaction that people have following media hype and mainstream media news coverage -- TEMPORARILY hot candidates do much better in polls than prediction markets.  Prediction market traders see past the hype and discount for future success and/or failure, not just current standing.

I believe in prediction markets because prediction markets are driven by knowledgable people who want to trade or bet real hard-earned cash on their insights.  As we might expect prediction markets are extremely accurate indication of where the electorate is at a given time -- the prediction markets result from election day almost always matches up exactly with the final result before the networks have called the election.  

So let's look at prediction markets ... first look at the [current GOP Presidential nomination race](http://www.predictwise.com/politics/2016RepNomination)
