A government has a strategy. The people have counter strategies.

It USED to be that governments had the inside edge on gathering the data and formulating better strategies -- but increasingly that is no longer true -- governments have inept, inflexible, archaic sub-optimal strategies, whereas people have smarter, more sophisticated, more intensely-responsive strategies.

I do not know *exactly* why I am so intensely intrigued by things like new computer languages ... I almost worry about the fascination sometimes ... but I am engrossed in things that enable collaborative workflows like the Julia Language, or tools for collaborative language polyglottery such as the Jupyter Project, including both Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab and [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howitworks.html) ... but it's mostly about how language enables thinking -- that includes the data analysis that provides the sophistication and accuracies in the strategies of people ... I am not particularly interested in policy prescriptions for governments, although I get that people [especially investors and fund managers] can benefit from having [quantitative economic](http://quantecon.org/notebooks.html) models [including models of government policy] for their own information and use in their own industries and economic spheres.  I TOTALLY understand that shiny new tools are dangerous for their distractive power and their POWER in providing the WRONG answers. Nothing sends people to the ER like the exuberance of a new power tool. But *eventually* we figure out how to use the power tool for maximum productivity and, maybe even more importantly, TIMELINESS ... and one farmer can PERFECTLY plant more acres of a crop at exactly the right right time with his giant tractor pulling a sophisticated planting implement than armies of planters could have ever planted with their hoes and bags of seed.

joined the [Jupyter Hackpad ](https://jupyter.hackpad.com/) because I believe that [Jupyter Lab](http://jupyterlab-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is really a big deal ... sort of like Linux really looked spooky big 25 years ago, when a new riff on the Minix clone of Unix was small enough to be ignored because the gold standard was still a PCs running DOS or Windows NT ... but some could generally see that it was a big enough of an idea that you knew it was somehow GOING TO amount to something in the fall of 1991.  

Well, I think Jupyter is going to be an even bigger deal because of things like [Jupyter Hackpad Weekly Dev Meetings](https://jupyter.hackpad.com/collection/zCqMrBELzrv) ... although I still suspect that Jupyter, like Linux, will ultimately be driven by an individual leading a small core development group.

Of course, the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was already a big deal because of what it means for team workflows ... sharing and and walking through code and data science ...and since those workflows change, what is important is how the Notebook extends the basic console-based approach to interactive computing in a qualitatively new direction, providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results.

The Jupyter Notebook combines two components: 1) A web application and 2) notebook documents.  The web application is a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output.  The notebook documents provide a representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.  

But [Jupyter Lab](https://blog.jupyter.org/2016/07/14/jupyter-lab-alpha/) puts extensibility on steroids by making it easy to extend the already venerable [Jupyter notebook for data science teams](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/jupyter-notebook-for/9781771375030/) and provide a foundation for continued extensions of [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/about.html) with [the PhosphorJS libraries](http://phosphorjs.github.io/about.html).

My curation of content is not what it should be ... maybe it is, but what I am referring to is the explosion of really important ideas in the realm of data science ... and the need to amp up one's situational awareness of development in this professional realm of knowledge ... using the tools of data science, ie a Jupyter notebook of notebooks, data visualizations, webinars, code repos and Github codegraphs.

I recently started thinking that I need to spend a fair amount of time ... maybe as much as four hours a day (*Is that way too much?!  NOT ENOUGH??!!*) engaged in skimming / sipping / "swimming in the deep end" from what I call the "Data Science Ecosystem Firehose"
