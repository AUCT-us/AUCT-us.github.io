# Sharing exchanges aew preferrable to just owning and under-utlizing an asset.

*But there's more to it than just getting a return on an underutilized asset...*

We can get starting point by thinking about the existing sharing platforms ... sharing platforms might be dismissed or underreported because they might seem to be revolutionarily non-traditional and unproven, disruptive of other working alternatives, ie taxi owners  dislike hate Uber, hotels dislike AirBnb or they don't generate enough advertising for established media companies. 

What follows below are 250 sharing economy examples organized by category. These examples are each independently meaningful, particularly for what new ideas which these exchanges add as alternatives. 

It is probably the differences **and NEW DIFFERENTIATORS** that help us to think more deeply, more richly about enabling more efficient use of resources through sharing economy principles, but this collection of 250 working exchanges is only the tip of a sharing information iceberg which we can all share.

Transport & Vehicles:

In general, [Car-As-A-Service (CAAS) companies](https://www.crunchbase.com/discover/organizations/field/org_similarity.is_org_similarity.forward/source_categories/car-sharing) creates alternatives for people that were not available or unthinkable before; these companies facilitate brand new connections between people who need or prefer temporary transportation and car owners who might need to defray the expense of little-used cars or turn them into income-generating assets or part-time gigs for drivers that might dovetail with other auto-related gigs such as [expedited] package delivery or [courrier services](https://www.crunchbase.com/discover/organization.companies/7e30e2883d29f8d8c5bc80ef01542984). These kinds of transport-sharing services can be especially valuable in locations with limited traditional rental or delivery options. These innovative companies provide useful information and value to the market since they need to *try harder* or swing for the fences in generating valuable, new ideas in order to survive. Some of these companies appear to be particularly well-managed and well-positioned for continued growth, but of course, things the development of self-driving cars could potentially disrupt the entire transport sharing/rental industry.

1. [BlaBlaCar](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blablacar) - Long-distance carpooling or ridesharing is a French ridesharing company founded in 2006. Its key differentiator is focusing on long-distance carpooling, to connect drivers with riders to fill empty seats between cities, unlike Uber/Lyft which serve local trips and can be shared, but probably not as much as BlaBlaCar. The name comes from how much conversation ("blah blah") or talking that drivers want with passengers - users can indicate if they're "Bla" (quiet), "BlaBla" (chatty), or "BlaBlaBla" (very talkative), so that they get grouped appropriately, per chattiness ... *which makes a lot of sense for long road trips*. It's particularly popular in Europe, where the long-distance carpooling platform serves over 70 million users across 22 countries. Two unique aspects of this company are a cost-sharing model where drivers only charge to split expenses, not for profit and an advance booking system for planned journeys rather than on-demand rides.

2. [Turo](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/turo) - this peer-to-peer car rental has established itself as a significant player in the car-sharing market, with a much wider selection of unique vehicles than traditional rental companies. Turo's unique, luxury and higher-end cars tend to be expensive and little-used. With Turo, these cars can become income-generating assets for their owners (hosts) and it gives people a chance to try a bigger range of cars that they might be thinking about purchasing. Turo has acquired 4 organizations. Turo's most recent acquisition was OuiCar on Jun 1, 2022, but other acquisitions might be in the pipeline.

3. [Getaround](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/getaround) - ***Hourly*** car sharing for more time-limited [and thus geography-limited] CaaS.
