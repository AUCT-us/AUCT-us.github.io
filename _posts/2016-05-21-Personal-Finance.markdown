1) The most essential thing to understand is personal finance is not about investments, it is about YOU. The person who looks to the opinions of others or measures his wealth according to others will NEVER have enough wealth and will always be impoverished. Stop being needy; stop groveling; stop whining, stop being an entitled victim. Do NOT waste ANY time making excuses or thinking that somebody else has it easy. Stop imagining that somebody else should bail you out or invest in your idea. 

2) Invest in your productivity every single day ... do what is possible for you, do not worry about the impossible -- get in shape so that you can get in shape so that you can get in shape and the impossible will become possible.  Whether you are a morning person or not, get up at 4:39 AM and CRUSH your workout ... even if your workout is almost nothing. Physical fitness drives mental fitness. You do not need a gym or dojo membership -- you can do burpees, pushups, yoga, run stairs, do housework. When you start CRUSHING each day's workout, tomorrow's workout will stop being nothing.

3) Invest in your health, nutrition and diet every single day ... do what is possible, do not worry about the impossible.  Eat better today than you did yesterday and commit to doing this every day for the rest of your life. You know what you should eat; you know what you can afford. For most of eating better is a matter of eating LESS, particularly of one or two things we know we should avoid. If you slip up and have a Krispy Kreme or something you know you shouldn't have eaten, do not dwell on it -- just eat better tomorrow.

4) Avoid distractions and costly habits and addictions; avoid friends with addictions. Instead work more on things of value to others that you enjoy. Most creative people and multi-millionaires are working fiendishly on seven to ten serious projects. You cannot tell which of these projects will pay off or when it will pay off -- the important thing is to keep working obsessively on what you enjoy.

5) Invest in the ideas affecting your mind. Develop a reading list, but understand there are few if any GOOD new ideas ... the best ideas are those that have been around for 2000 years and still inspire current thinking. For example, read and internalize [what Seneca said about wealth](https://25iq.com/2015/05/28/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-seneca-the-younger-about-venture-capital-startups-business-and-life/) ... Google Seneca routinely to find new reflections from brilliant people on how they apply the words of Seneca to their lives.  In order to escape poverty, it's essential that you look HARD at how you are spending money and either invent, find or STEAL better ways to enjoy life more while spending less. When you have developed ways to get your cost of living down to $0/day, you don't need much of a fortune to be fabulously wealthy.
