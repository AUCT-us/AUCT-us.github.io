Collaborative artificial intelligence has emerged as one of my most intriguing and interesting [philanthropic venture](http://markbruns.github.io/philanthropy/mvp/opensource/2017/07/15/Venture-Philanthropy.html) areas ... I believe that collaboration on HARD projects is necessarily about the physics of people or, more practically, about the physics of bringing people together, getting them "on the same page." To some extent, this is about messaging systems and utilities like git repositories -- in other words, it's not necessarily about real time immediate messaging, although things like videoconferences can be part of it. Perhaps, the biggest need in Collaborative AI is just findability or search ... to bring people together who are working on similar things, similar snippets of code, similar problems.

In other words, collaborative AI is not about people people collaborating on doing machine learning, deep learning, neural nets or other forms of artificial intelligence -- it's about using AI to facilitate qualifying collaborators and bringing people together to collaborate and providing the interface that gets out of the way so that people can collaborate ... as if they are sitting next to one another, without requiring them to be sitting next to one another.
