**Why did we start curating this reading list?**
We noticed GIGANTIC positives that arose from covid that completely unintentional and probably completely unexpectedly ... maybe we should have seen the positives coming, but it was truly shocking, especially in terms of how much people embraced working from anywhere. The way that this happened reminded us of how incredibly negative human inertia is OR how many opportunities that humans have, but completely miss those opportunities, because they insist on have things the same old way that they always had them. This particular example reminds us, once again, why ***people who are recalcitrantly and mindlessly consistent, ie too set in their ways are a BURDEN upon their family, friends and neighbors.***

The huge jump in interest of [#RemoteJobs](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23remotejobs&src=typeahead_click&f=live) and [#RemoteWork](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23remotework&src=typed_query&f=live) was simply too large, too positive, to0 significant to ignore ... but it is a rapidly evolving landscape, ie the maps that anyone had for understanding the talent acquisition landscape in the first half of 2020 are quite simply completely irrelevant now ... the landscape is still changing and it does not particularly care what anyone's map says it is supposed to be.
