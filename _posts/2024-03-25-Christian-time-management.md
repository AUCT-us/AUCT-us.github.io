*For Christians, there can be no other day in the year that is more genuinely worthy of a SPECIAL day of celebration than the Sunday that is coming up. Easter is THE reason we are Christians; the CELEBRATION of Easter really MATTER to us.*

# The NECESSITY of perspective and priorities.

First things FIRST. First, we need to understand the framework of perspective and priorities.

We LOVE our Creator above all else ... we don't love the idea of some magical Santa Claus like Greek or Roman mythical god ... this is ALL about terminology.

We DEFINE God as whatever *IT* was, the entity, the force, the origin of ALL laws and principles that brought about everything in the Universe into existence AND not just brought it into existence but could also create infinite numbers of different laws, different principles of infinite numbers of different Universes.

It's a DEFINITION of terms... this is not a matter of BELIEF!

It's NECESSARY to understand the significance of what terminology means for how we THINK.

We DEFINING terms, so that we can speak to others and convey ideas ... God is shorter than saying *"whatever* ***IT*** *was, the entity, the force, the origin of ALL laws and principles that brought about everything in the Universe into existence AND not just brought it into existence but could also create infinite numbers of different laws, different principles of infinite numbers of different Universes"* ... everytime what we want to speak about THE REASON why we have ANYTHING. 

**It's ONLY about the WORD we use to convey the very huge idea of the grand ORIGIN of everything ... but there ARE truly evil people who want to use WORDS to cause hate and arouse enmity and create division where there there should be none.**

We DEFINE God as The Origin ... the thing driving everything that brought us into existence ... the REASON that our *brains boot up at the start of our days*; the originating, grand REASON for everything has happened so that we even get to think about what it means to think ... God's name for God's *self* is ***"I AM"*** ... we ascribe pronouns to God, but God's pronoun really is just ***I*** ... and the only verb God needs to use is ***AM***. Because God is literally the initial origin of EVERYTHING that is, ever was, and ever will be  ... this is not debatable; instead, it is matter of DEFINITION of terminology and the words we use in our language to convey ideas ... it's not a matter of belief.

## Why games matter

We engage in games because we enjoy them immensely ... when we say that we LOVE those games ... it's kind of a figure of speech ... it's not exactly like our LOVE of our Creator or our LOVE for the most ORIGINAL of all of our earlies ORIGINs ... but that LOVE is child-like love; it's matter of PURE, UNADULTERATED, COMPLETE, WHOLE enjoyment. 

But when we LOVE something ... like the sport of wrestling or jiu jitsu ... we have to realize that love is extremely FINITE ... not everybody's into it ... not everyone else will share that love OR will have a love like our own unique love of the sport.

We really HAVE to keep our LOVE of the sport in perspective ... we have to prioritize that LOVE according to other things that we need to attend to. 

For example, we will need money to pay our bills in life ... we don't need billions or even millions or fancy things ... we might JUST love wrestling or maybe jiu jitsu so much that we can have a very ascetic lifestyle and do not really need or want anything else ... but we still need to be responsible and figure out how we are going to pay our bills ... it's not responsible to be financially irresponsible and be like a child forever and have some *parent* figure or *coach* or wealthy philanthropist arrange to pay for our wrestling ... when we do something like that, beyond a certain point in life, it's kind of abnormal and we can almost expect to be abused [even though it's still a CRIME to abuse someone who is mentally handicapped or developmentallyy disabled or child-like or unable to manage their affairs, eg a senior citizen with demential] ... we should allow ourselves to be put in a position where we can be abused ... thus, we should be responsible for ourselves and our own affairs.

But if we are responsible for ourselves and our own affairs, we can still LOVE our sport of wrestling or jiu jitsu ... we just need to keep things in apprpropriate perspective and prioritize our LOVE of the sport according to other things that we need to attend to.

When we LOVE something, we should do those those things that allow us to enjoy it to the fullest extent possible ... we should be able to enjoy it in a way that is not harmful to ourselves or others ... in fact, if it's a true love that is really justifiable, we should look for those ways or those opportunities for ways for that LOVE help pay its way. 

For example, a wrestling lifestyle or jiu jitsu lifestyle, can/will keep us healthier and more fit and better able to enjoy a full life AS WE AGE ... we might not want to grapple [at full speed] with others after a certain age, but we can still do drills, work through moves and techniques, watch competitions and discuss strategies and tactics with others ... we can still be involved in the sport in a way that is meaningful and enjoyable to us; if our LOVE of the sport is genuine, we don't need to be spending time at the top of the winner's podium at the Olympics or the NCAA Tournament ... we can find all kinds of other ways to be involved in the sport that are still meaningful and even more enjoyable as we age ... in fact, when we find ourselves hating age, hating getting older and just generally frustrated and grumpy, we need to recognize that we're doing something wrong and that we need to ADAPT our a wrestling lifestyle or jiu jitsu lifestyle to changing realities. 

## The 86400 seconds per day

### USE it or LOSE it

We ONLY have 86400 seconds per day ... but we can do A LOT in a few seconds when we THINK about how much we can get done in very few seconds ... think about how much we accomplish if we JUST ROLL for about or 14.4 minutes or 864 seconds [just 1/100th of our day] ... in less than 14 minutes, we can do sets of drills in which we pretend that we're have two a three period matches, one right after another, each with a 3 minute period on our feet, 2 minutes on bottom and 2 minutes controlling from the top position ... 2*3 + 2*2 + 2*2 is 14 minutes or 840 seconds. 

We need to USE all of those 86400 seconds ... if we don't USE them, we LOSE them.

### PAY Attention 

We can optimize the use, just by paying closer attention ... when we walk, we need to paying attention and focusing on WALKING as perfectly as we have ever walked ... when we go up and down stairs, we need to PAY ATTENTION and focus on hitting each step exactly right and not just having the best stair climbing or stair descending experience ever but focusing on the little habits of doing it so that we get better as we age... at night, when we sleep--or even if we take short naps during the day--we have to have paid attention beforehand to optimizing our overall sleep hygiene before we sleep, so that each second of sleep we get through the night can be some of the best, most restful seconds of sleep we've ever had.

The MORE that we PAY ATTENTION ... the more able we will be to actually pay attention to what matters ... and to stop wasting any time hating or being frustrated or pissed off about shit that just ain't gonna matter.


### USE the tools, particularly in information technology 

We have better tools nowadays to accomplish things that we have ever had before. We need to USE those tools, particularly the ones that are almost cost-free ... increasingly that means that we need to be much more adept at using information technology in general and artificial intelligence in particular.

I asked my favorite AI assistant to brainstorm a list for me of 200 different things in the realm of activities, nutrition, lifestyle, furniture and social interactions that I can work on to help me improve upon my wrestling or jiu jitsu lifestyle as I age. I want to stay flexible healthy, physically and mentally fit, but I cannot compete or train physically with grappling partners any more because I am almost 65 and cannot afford to sustain an injury.  

We use AI to brainstorm lists like this in order to better use our time ... the list is FAR from perfect, but it's okay at what it's intended to do ... to get us STARTED THINKING ... or to get us to STOP THINKING about the bullshit that our untamed mind wants to bitch about ...  the AI list is ONLY THE START OF THE BRAINSTORMING PROCESS ... it gives us a QUICK START, faster than we can think one up ourselves ... but we will, of course, need to throw out a lot of junk AI produces ... but the speed of generating these lists means will also need to delve deeper and ask for more brainstormed lists on the things that are worth pursuing ... MORE IDEAS are necessary to grind up the bin of ideas to produce the VERY FEW ideas that we should DO.

For example, here is a list of 200 different things that the AI suggests a 65-year-old can work on to improve your wrestling or jiu-jitsu lifestyle as you age, focusing on activities, nutrition, lifestyle, furniture, and social interactions that can help you stay flexible, healthy, and physically and mentally fit:
