So what if [the tiny house trend is becoming ordinary, untrendy and boring](https://www.kasita.com/is-the-tiny-house-trend-dead/) ... does that really matter? In a way, I think it does in a way ... the [Kasita container-esque idea](https://www.kasita.com/#about) HAS TO escape the Austin cartoon of itself [or the Portlandia cartoon of Portland] orbit ... as well as the tiny house trend orbit ... or it will die. I believe Kasita homes and Kasita parks and the Kasita concept MIGHT have the capacity to do that -- since, the Kasita concept is one of the VERY FEW tiny house ideas that could survive the collapse of the tiny house trend universe if that is actually happening ... **but I am SKEPTICAL.**

Part of my skepticism is driven by Kasita designers' iPhone-ey focus on design RATHER than than Android/Linux focus on very long-term extensibility ... which is an intensely practical matter of function ... and the next generation's functionality ... and functionality for the generations after that.  Most of my skepticism is driven by my skepticism for ALL design ideas ... ALL political ideas ... ALL ideas ... especially those which are merely whimsical or quirky or trendy or hip.  

*There are a lot of houses and ghettos of houses out there in the world of ideas that should be burned down before they hurt somebody.*

My critique of ANY tiny house idea, especially a proprietary, non-standard or one-off quirky hipster idea, is driven by a simple, deliberately harsh and nasty question, "After I die, could the executor of my estate pick up the phone and call a listing agent or some sort of broker/auctioneer who would readily convince someone else to buy the cute little toy and live in the box? Does the idea still work long after the joke's not funny any more and everyone in the world thinks it's just a boring, disgusting, ubiquitous piece of trash (ie worse than a some hoarder's mobile home rats nest in a trailer park)?"  

Remodeling, re-appliance-ing, re-customizing homes is a completely banal idea, but it is a significant standard, structural, strategic ADVANTAGE of residential construction that we should not ignore, any more than we should ignore how water expands when it freezes or runs downhill.  We should ask if the basic shell of idea re-saleable like a 20' shipping container or is the cute little quirky rat's nest a disgusting liability somebody will have to handle in hazmat suits, like a hoarder's collection of potentially hazardous, too-precious-to-part-with trash?

BTW ... have you tried on a [20' shipping container](http://www.ebay.com/bhp/20-ft-shipping-container) recently?  I'm guessing that a shipping container would fits you better than anything else you will find in the tiny house menagerie of goofball ideas ... and it's probably is a good way to transport any possession you need anywhere in the world [and if you need more things than a 20' shipping container, you might need to re-prioritize and 5S your life] ... and guess what, there's actually a pretty vibrant MARKET for used shipping containers, regardless of what kind of hipster slob you are.
