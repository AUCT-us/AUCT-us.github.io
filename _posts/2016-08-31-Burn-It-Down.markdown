[*You know that I like moldy ecosystems as much as the next guy*](http://markbruns.github.io/bioremediation,/antibiotics,/enzymes,/metagenomics,/soil/ecosystems/2016/08/24/White-Rot.html), but ... I am wondering,"So what if [the tiny house trend is becoming ordinary, untrendy and boring](https://www.kasita.com/is-the-tiny-house-trend-dead/) ... does that really matter if the tiny house trend dies as a trend and becomes a stable, mature and more solid STANDARD?" In a way, I think the demise of the trendiness would be a GREAT thing ... the longer-term survival of the tiny house STANDARD might depend upon letting the more extreme and goofy ideas just die before they hurt anyone.  

Standardization sounds simple ... as long as we can get others to standardize on our way of doing things ... but standardization is HARD.  

Standardization means that there are some hard, practical choices and decisions that some of the principal players might need to make ... these decisions are VOLUNTARY choices, but they must be intensely considerate of other people's ideas, in order to allow standardization to be possible.  Nothing gets accepted as STANDARD unless there is almost unanimous consensus ... almost NO designers are considerate enough by nature to produce true STANDARDS.  They dream of producing a standard; they can imagine that they are the Kind of France and mandate their standard on everyone else, but in spite of how mortal designers love to imagine that they can have the power of Steve Jobs, the fact is that there was one Steve Jobs and he has left the building.  

The [Kasita container-esque idea](https://www.kasita.com/#about) HAS TO escape the Austin cartoon of itself [or the Portlandia cartoon of Portland] orbit ... as well as the tiny house trend orbit ... or it will die. I believe Kasita homes and Kasita parks and the Kasita concept MIGHT have the capacity to do that -- since, the Kasita concept is one of the VERY FEW tiny house ideas that could survive the collapse of the tiny house trend universe if that is actually happening ... **but I am SKEPTICAL.**

Part of my skepticism is driven by Kasita designers' iPhone-ey focus on design RATHER than than Android/Linux focus on open source STANDARDIZATION and very long-term extensibility ... which is an intensely practical matter of function ... and the next generation's functionality ... and functionality for the generations after that.  Most of my skepticism is driven by my skepticism for ALL design ideas ... ALL political ideas ... ALL ideas ... especially those which are merely whimsical or quirky or trendy or hip.  Some people are attached to their moldy, funky non-standard ideas in the same way that hoarders are attached boxes full of unique crap covered in black mold ... the uniquer, moldier and funkier, the deeper the attachment.

*A lot of houses and ghettos of houses in the world of ideas that should be burnt down ... before they hurt someone.*

My critique of ANY tiny house idea, especially a proprietary, non-standard or one-off quirky hipster idea, is driven by a simple, deliberately harsh and nasty question, "After I die, could the executor of my estate pick up the phone and call a listing agent or some sort of broker/auctioneer who would readily convince someone else to buy [or even just assume ownership of at no cost] the cute little toy and live in the box? Does the idea still work long after the joke's not funny any more and everyone in the world thinks it's just a boring, disgusting, ubiquitous piece of trash (ie worse than a some hoarder's mobile home rats nest in a trailer park)?"  

Remodeling, re-appliance-ing, re-customizing homes is a completely banal idea, but it is a significant standard, structural, strategic ADVANTAGE of residential construction that we should not ignore, any more than we should ignore how water expands when it freezes or how turds strongly prefer to flow downhill.  We should ask if the basic shell of idea re-saleable like a 20' shipping container or is the cute little quirky rat's nest a disgusting liability that somebody will either have to nuke and make the sand glow OR some poor slob sweating in a hazmat suit will have to dispose of, like a hoarder's collection of potentially hazardous, too-precious-to-part-with trash?

BTW ... have you tried a [20' shipping container](http://www.ebay.com/bhp/20-ft-shipping-container) on for size recently?  I'm guessing that a shipping container would fit you better than anything else you will find in the tiny house menagerie of goofball ideas ... and it's probably is a good way to transport any possession you need anywhere in the world [and if you need more things than a 20' shipping container, you might need to re-prioritize and 5S your life] ... and guess what, unlike other tiny house ideas which are basically about as marketable as a used condom, there's actually a pretty vibrant MARKET for used shipping containers, after you get done with your shipping container, regardless of what kind of hipster slob you are.  In other words, before you ask me to put my shoulder to the wheel or invest in any tiny house venture, convince me that the idea driving your business will make your business a better value than investing in a bunch of 20' shipping containers.
