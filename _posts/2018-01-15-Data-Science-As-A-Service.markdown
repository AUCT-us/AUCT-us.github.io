1. Enjoyment comes from reliability; reliability is mostly about simplification

   Making things simple sounds easy, but simple is HARD. It is not easy to take out inefficiencies, bad practices and anti-patterns out that do not add sufficient value. It is easy to be distracted. Consider for example how easy it is to be whipped into a frenzy over a news item such the deadly Ebola virus or end of civilization as we know it driven by change in net neutality policy. Instead of wasting any time on news and hysteria about [Trump's Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump) it would be much better for people to devote that energy to things like [routine data detox](https://datadetox.myshadow.org/detox), housekeeping of messages and RSS feeds, exercise, doing jiu jitsu or a [solid intermittent fasting program](https://idmprogram.com/). Devoting more energy to tidying things up, sorting, standardizing, refactoring, standardizing on best practices and generally continually working on radically simplfying the clutter and technical debt that builds up in life will do far more to make things more reliable, simpler ... and more generally enjoyable.

2. The most interesting and enjoyable communities are natural communities.

    Nature is the great simplifier. Nature is not just enjoyable, reliable and regenerative, it is ferociously rejuvenative, beautifully antifragile and mercilessly competitive. Exploring natural communities not only allows one to explore much that is far more beautiful and elegant than anything humans do, it also allows us to explore how ecosystems depend upon predator-prey relationships. As with jiu jitsu, natural ecosytems show us how different species are all delicate and subject to attack or getting flanked by some other lifeform or disease or aging or inherent weakness. The true beauty of nature is that everything dies ... as a result, life really matters ... no animal can just spin up another machine instance and instantiate another life -- and yet the cycles of life go on and one and over time ecoystems get steadily more elegant and robust ... while the species within them remain fragile, delicate and beautiful.

3.  The economics of space and time have been very significant to the development of human culture, human economies ... but how we use data now has really changed that.

    The productivity we obtain through data, especially for data analysis that leads to radically better awareness of choices and radically better allocation of resources; it allows the human species to transcend geography to be radically more efficient and squander far fewer resources moving physical things or even power around. A simpler, more reliable, less wasteful economy transports less stuff and fewer people ... except for those [relatively] isolated cases where people derive an intrinsic benefit from the excitement of traveling, ie for many of us [who have had to travel a lot] travel is just not that exciting anymore.

    We shouldn't forget about the relative uncertainties, difficulties and costs of transport. It is cheaper, easier to use a plane or vehicle to move something than to carry it or to have a human courier deliver it [or to have to operate, without information technology, in dense urban environment where human couriers make sense]... it's cheaper to cheap to use a truck than tons of it is to use hundreds of cars ... it's cheaper to use a train than a truck ... it's cheaper to use a pipeline than a train ... it is cheaper to use a power line or a cable to move energy [and data] than a pipeline ... it is cheaper to use a fiber optic cable to move data than it is use energy ... it is cheapest of all when we have efficient networks that allow us to transport only the data necessary in order to perform the analysis to support better choices, better allocations, better logistics so that less moving of stuff and people is necessary in the overall system.      

4. The most vital economies, cultural communities and social networks are not geographically constrained.

    Consider the explosion of interest in Kubernetes and TensorFlow. The distributed development of communities of developers who use and extend open source technologies is probably the big driving reason why capital simply doesn't matter AS MUCH any more. Most views of economics are wrong or incomplete; even those who have informed views on economics, finance and investment tend to have backward-facing views that still look at how things worked a decade or five ago. Demands for [and returns available to savers of] capital are now very low by historical standards. It not because economies are stagnant, but it more that capital simply does not really explain as much it once did  -- yes, of course, capital and capital markets still matter. Similarly, anyone involved in mfg will tell you that labor costs do not really drive manufacturing costs any more, but labor productivity does.  Companies don't build mfg plants in other places or go offshore or overseas to escape high labor costs, corporate managements do what they can and must to adapt ... to escape INCREASING taxation, to avoid uncertainties about regulatory intransigence and to free themselves from the stifling INFLEXIBILITY of unions.

5.  Human life and the economic ecosystems that sustain human life in the 21st century is more about data and the transformation of data into productive knowledge and business intelligence.

    Criminals, terrorists and enemies of freedom understand this ... maybe better than most other people do. The overall state of information security is ***maybe*** getting worse or not keeping up and [teams of hackers are getting enormously more sophisticated at exploiting the typical careless nonchalance or semi-disregard for information security that most have](https://www.wired.com/story/worst-hacks-2017/). Which is another reason why the popular, reported, traditional news topics are a complete DISTRACTION ... just as much as NFL football and Netflix are not much more than escapism [although, in certain realms of human existence, the need for escapism might be real enough]. The tracking that matters in the digital realm is not really the stuff the NSA or some other government agency Big Brother does ... what really matters is everything ELSE that is tracked by the most shrewd digital hunter-gatherers who employ the best minds of our generation ... everything about our assumptions, perceptions, behaviors, choices, attitudes, psychological precursors that show up in our economic lives or tendencies to purchase.
