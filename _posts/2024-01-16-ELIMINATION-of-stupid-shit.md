In the previous post, I described my $5000 content spend for 2024 ... the flip side of that is what will remove, minimize or phase out in 2024.  

This post is in some ways about offsetting what I increase ... but actually, the same strategy is driving bothe. I recognize that these things are making me weaker and maybe less able to confront things, so it is necessary for really get my mind back to ***"being a predatory killer/eater again."***  

It might sound extreme, but it's really about being HEALTHY ... and that means being able to go hungry, able to live in discomfort, able to do HARD things ... so it really IS about getting back to ***"being a predatory killer/eater again."***  

*I apologize if people find the language to be extreme ... but that's just the way it has to be.*  One simply HAS TO BE in that frame of mind if one wishes to be healthy.


## I will try to minimize everything that does not make me stronger, more courageous, less afraid

Taking things away is bit like FASTING ... not exactly extended fasting ... it's actually more like eating ONE GREAT MEAL A DAY in order to restore control of one's appetites.  But there'd be nothing wrong with a few bouts of extended fasting for me right now ... I have found that extended fasts do help me to be more courageous, less afraid.

The point is not to COMPLAIN, NEVER WHINE, NEVER MAKE EXCUSES ... of course, nobody wants to live in unbearable discomfort and pain -- but the quickest way to get into that state is actually from endulging the standard American diet or eating at restaurant ... of course, one should exercise and feel a BIT of discomfort every day ... the point is not to suffer, but to press out on one's limits ... to remove the lethargy ... it's mostly about taking away the American lifestyle of convenience and comfort, focusing first on eliminating ALL of stupid shit that makes me worse off ... the same general mentality applies thoroughout ALL of my purchases.

That's why there's no drinking any more for me ... I not only avoid alcohol like the plague but I also find that I have to avoid friends/family members who drink ... because it's too demoralizing to have a conversation with imbeciles.

In a nutshell, moving to ASYNCHRONOUS WORKFLOWS and completely virtual workflow is about placing a priority on making the most of everyone's time; people who need to have physical meetings tend to be time wasters. This is why the removal of the convenience or WEAKNESS of automotive culture is behind my severe minimization of all driving ... I have learned that I not only strongly prefer to walk everywhere, but I also need to make sure that I am able walk, ie my knees or my back is not bothering me, I can carry a large pack and not get blisters or sore muscles on my feet after hiking several miles ... I do make accomodations to travel for things that are absolute business necessities, but I find that there are fewer and fewer of these necessities AS I LEARN that many meeting/conf organizers are entirely MINDLESS when it comes to agendas of physical meetings or work that they imagine requires a physical presence. 

When it comes to carbs ... I have done it before ... I don't like the serious withdrawl pains that come with an abrupt cessation  ... but it's time again for me to wean myself from processed foods, breads, sugars and most carbohydrates ... I will not lie, eliminating these things tends to be hard on me ... these standard American diet things are extremely cheap, so they appeal to my tendency to opt for cheap calories/cheap protein as I pinch pennies [and still get that short-term sugar high or satiating "boost" from a bread item] ... but I recognize that these things are making me weaker and maybe less able to confront things, so it is necessary for get my mind back to *"just being a predatory killer/eater again."*

# Spending SMARTER on fixed assets

Phase out the vehicle ... spend minimal amount necessary to keep vehicle road worthy ... the ultimate plan is not to own a vehicle.

The general strategy in home repair/maintenance is to minimize use, PUT OFF maintenance, PUT OFF improvements, PUT OFF all upgrades ... it's all about keeping the power dry and saving money for the eventual remod.  Sure, I still need a servicable place to live ... but I will continue to put off improvements and save money for what I see as LARGE coming remods as long as I can ... eventually the house will probably need a new roof, new windows [and probably new siding], a new deck/porch/conservatory or south facing atrium ... but, frankly, the highest and best use of these two lots property might be demolition and reconstruction [since the property has been re-classified to be within a floodzone.]

On landscape architecture, I will continue to invest in soil building and attempting to extend/prolong the life of the trees ... add plants, shaping the terrain and attempting re-shape the landscape MANUALLY ... for the lifting and exercise.  Along the way, I will dismantle the rock/paver impediments and repurpose those things as terracing aids to generally retain water around the property, as close to where the rain falls because drowth is going to be a permanent consideration on property build on top of gravel fill. In order to reduce Summer temperatures by 20-25 degrees on the property, will reduce any paved area solar heat collectors and replace those areas garden items grown in movable, optimizable bags of improved soil.  I have used geraniums as soil building aids as I compost organic material into something that will eventually resemble a higher quality soil ... the main benefit of geraniums is their riduculous hardiness and durability in the face of neglect; since geraniums are tough to kill, I have found them to be helpful as indicators of soil readiness for use. My soil transformation process is sort of simple and crude; I just use vermiculite with composted leaves/twigs mixed in with the ridiculously junky fill and gravelly sand that comprised the "fill" which was used as the topsoil this property  ... it's time to level off my population of geraniums and just renew/refresh/repot as I use the soil that formerly grew geraniums for garden containers ... this soil has never really grown a decent crop of crabgrass, but it will grow broadleafs and [with sufficient fertilization will support little tufts of turfgrass seedlings that can be mowed, but perpetually need to be re-established

## A Better Plan Starts with BETTER Knowing The WHY of the Plan

My WHY is about being a BETTER example of my WHY ... of course, I don't exactly know my WHY yet ... for me, this existence is about pondering that WHY.

I am seeking to minimize the time that I waste by not being in a state of prayerful contemplation.

PRAYER. MORE PRAYER. ALL DAY PRAYER.
