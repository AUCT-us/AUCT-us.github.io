This syllabus covers a wide range of topics in graph theory, from the basic definitions and terminology to advanced concepts and applications. It includes modules on graph algorithms, combinatorial aspects of graph theory, algebraic and structural graph theory, random graphs and probabilistic methods, and various applications of graph theory in different fields.

By following this syllabus, learners will gain a solid foundation in graph theory and develop the necessary skills to apply graph-theoretic concepts and techniques to solve real-world problems. The modular structure allows for flexibility in learning, enabling learners to focus on specific areas of interest while still maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the subject.

### [Graph Traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_traversal) or graph search and [NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness) algorithms such as the [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), [maximum flow problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem) [maze generation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm) (30 modules):

#### 21-24: Depth-First Search (DFS) and its applications

### [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) and [Combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics) (30 modules):

[Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) are fundamental objects in combinatorics. Considerations of graph theory range from [enumeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerative_combinatorics) (e.g., the number of graphs on n vertices with k edges) to existing [structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure) (e.g., [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path) [cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory))) to [algebraic representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory) (e.g., given a graph G and two numbers x and y, does the [Tutte polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutte_polynomial) TG(x,y) have a [combinatorial interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroid)? The combinatorial interpretation of the Tutte polynomial provides a powerful tool for studying the structure and properties of [undirected graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Undirected_graph), and it has applications in various areas, including [network reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_network), [quantum computation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00477-0) and [statistical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics), and [knot theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory) and [knot mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics)).). Although there are very strong connections between graph theory and combinatorics, they are sometimes thought of as separate subjects. While combinatorial methods apply to many graph theory problems, the two disciplines are generally used to seek solutions to different types of problems.
