*An imperfect child of God üåü attempting to become an empathüßéüèæ who cannot possibly ever communicate how GRATEFUL he is to our Creator for every moment of his existence! [Philippians 4:8-9](https://www.biblestudytools.com/philippians/4-8-compare.html)*

This program is structured with an eye to emphasizing biblical studies, systematic theology, historical theology, and practical ministry training, but without the language requirements of learning Hebrew, Greek or German. The biblical language courses [that would ordinarily be part of a four-year Doctor of Divinity degree] have been replaced with additional courses focusing on Old Testament and New Testament studies, exegesis, and interpretation using modern tools and translations.

In general, the overall program will autodidictic students to complete a substantial research dissertation [or blog compendium], along with practical internships and practicums throughout the program.

#### 7.1. [Christology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christology) is branch of theology that concerns Jesus. Different denominations have different opinions on questions such as whether Jesus was human, divine, or both, and as a [Messiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah) what His role would be in the freeing of the Jewish people from foreign rulers or in the prophesied Kingdom of God, and in the salvation from what would otherwise be the consequences of sin.
         
#### 7.2. [Soteriology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soteriology) is the study of religious doctrines of [salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation) and deliverance of the [soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul) from [sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin) and its consequences. Salvation theory occupies a place of special significance in many religions. In the academic field of religious studies, soteriology is understood by scholars as representing a key theme in a number of different religions and is often studied in a comparative context; that is, comparing various ideas about what salvation is and how it is obtained.
         
#### 7.3. [Ecclesiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiology) is the study of the [Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_(congregation)), the [origins of Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Christianity#Origins_to_312), its relationship to [Jesus [in his foundational role in the monotheistic religion of Christianity]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Christianity), the church's role in [salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation), the [church's polity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_polity), the [church's discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_discipline), its [the church's eschatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology), and the [church's clergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy).
         
#### 7.4. [Eschatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology) concerns expectations of the end of the present age, human history, or the world itself. The end of the world or end times is predicted by several world religions (both Abrahamic and non-Abrahamic), which teach that negative world events will reach a climax. The Abrahamic religions maintain a linear cosmology, with end-time scenarios containing themes of transformation and redemption. In Judaism, the term "end of days" makes reference to the Messianic Age and includes an in-gathering of the exiled Jewish diaspora, the coming of the [Messiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah), the resurrection of the righteous, and the world to come. Christianity depicts the end time as a period of tribulation that precedes the **second** coming of Christ, who will face the rise of the Antichrist along with his power structure and false prophets, and usher in the Kingdom of God. In later traditions of Islam, separate hadiths detail the Day of Judgment is preceded by the appearance of the Masƒ´·∏• ad-DajjƒÅl, and followed by the descending of  øƒ™sƒÅ (Jesus), which shall triumph over the false Messiah or Antichrist; his defeat will lead to a sequence of events that will end with the sun rising from the west and the beginning of the QiyƒÅmah (Judgment Day).

[Lectio Divina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectio_Divina) (Latin for "Divine Reading") is a traditional contemplative practice of scriptural reading, meditation and **prayer** intended to promote communion with God and to increase the knowledge of God's word, by not treating Scripture as texts to be studied, ie as a literature class or aspiring actor might study Shakespeare or the Classics but, through prayerful intent, to become ALIVE as the living Word.
