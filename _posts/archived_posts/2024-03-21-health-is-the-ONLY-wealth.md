# Health is the ONLY wealth. The only health that really matters is the health of the soul.

I am healthy *BECAUSE* I avoid **ROUTINE** medical care and pharmaceuticals ... my time mgmt regime is a matter of RESPONDING to things in the world, RATHER THAN reacting to things as one is programmed and propagandized to react.

The Six Pillars of Health drive my allocation of time/energy/focus:

1) 50% of my energy/focus/time or 56 hours/week is allocated to [spiritual health](https://markbruns.github.io/Health/Spiritual/)

2) 25% of my energy/focus/time or 28 hours/week goes to [emotional health](https://markbruns.github.io/Health/Emotional/)

3) 12.5% of my energy/focus/time or 14 hours/week goes to [exercise](https://markbruns.github.io/Health/Exercise/)

4) 6.25% of my energy/focus/time or 7 hours/week goes to [nutrition](https://markbruns.github.io/Health/Nutrition/)

5) 3.125% of my energy/focus/time or 30 minutes/day is devoted to [sleep hygiene and everything necessary to ensure good rest](https://markbruns.github.io/Health/Sleep/). This is nothing little housekeeping things like making my bed and everything I do beforehand to set the stage for optimizing my sleep during the 56 hrs/week I spend sleeping

6) 3.125% of my energy/focus/time or 30 minutes/day is devoted to [supplementation](https://markbruns.github.io/Health/Supplements/), optimizing biochemistry, getting the right amount of sunlight, and miscellaneous other things that are not covered by the other five pillars of health
