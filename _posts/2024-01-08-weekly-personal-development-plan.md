# It's Just Week 2 of a LONG 52-Week Personal Development Syllabus

Every week counts ... especially the previous weeks.

When we ***return*** our foundations, we can finally begin to actually **build** on them ... after we have grown up, we can respect our parents ... *we don't have to make the effort to rebelliously make fun of the old fogey's who are still clinging to their outdated beliefs -- we can finally join them in their wisdom.*

We begin by looking at Week 1 ... and BUILDING on that foundation.

### Re-initializing or creating your new "first" weekly schedule with time blocks

### Time audit: tracking current time usage

### Defining personal and professional values

### Attention assessment: identifying major distractors and the Examen Journal

### Examen Journaling is more than just a procrastination log or documenting your avoidance tricks or maladaptive behaviors

### Setting and PDCAing initial short-term and long-term goals

### Reviewing and re-implementing all of the material that you have learned about written to goal setting and SMART criteria.

### Re-introduction to Catholic catechism and its relevance to self-control
