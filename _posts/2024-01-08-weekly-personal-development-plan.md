## Week 2: Establishing Baselines and Catholic Principles

When we ***return*** our foundations, we can finally begin to actually **build** on them ... after we have grown up, we can respect our parents ... *we don't have to make the effort to rebelliously make fun of the old fogey's who are still clinging to their outdated beliefs -- we can finally join them in their wisdom.*

1. Re-initializing or creating your new "first" weekly schedule with time blocks

2. Time audit: tracking current time usage

3. Defining personal and professional values

4. Attention assessment: identifying major distractors

5. Procrastination log: documenting avoidance behaviors

6. Setting initial short-term and long-term goals

7. Introduction to Catholic catechism and its relevance to self-control

8. Reviewing and re-implementing all of the material that you have learned about written to goal setting and SMART criteria.
