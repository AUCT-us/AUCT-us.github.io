## Automotive Cultures Fundamentally WEAKEN and IMPOVERISH

I regret every time I spent any money on an automotive upgrade ... when I had a MINIMALLY acceptable car, eg a $500 beater for commuting or anything better than what I needed to get me from point A to point B.

To really twist the knife ... my stock investments have generally done extremely well, even though I did not really have much to start with  ... for example, when I consider how much my $25,000 investment in Amazon in May, 1997 returned before I exited 20 years later, I am even more pissed off that I ever participated in the automotive circus ... I realize that I really wasted a lot of money on better cars than I needed ... ***but then again, the typical American citizen participating in our automotive culture was 5X maybe even 10X worse than I was*** ... the REASON that we cannot have nice things is the amount of resources that we have SQUANDERED on our automobiles and every thing that our automotive culture *provides* to us.

For anyone who has trouble connecting the dots ... because it is part of what is DRIVING my decision to make a hard, full, complete switch away from travelling to content and to instead invest more heavily in autodidactic training, eg just DOING drills and internalizing VIRTUAL content until it becomes my own.  

# YOU CANNOT GET THERE BY DRIVING TO IT.

Instead of going to that training event, *you would better off walking in that direction for half of the total time you would spend and then just turning around and walking home, while you were mentally rehearsing the content you SUPPOSEDLY were missing.*

***If it ain't VIRTUAL, it is JUNK.*** Even without the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies that are now available AND DROPPING IN PRICE.

It's important understand WHY **any kind of content that demands users travel or commute will have been developed by a mindless idiot who did not understand the costs that his physical seminar or training seminar imposed IN ADDITION TO THE time at the seminar.**  Thus, the content is fundamentally before it even starts ... but agendas of physical meetings also tend to be less productive than a coherent email. 

Physical content is now inherently WORTHLESS by comparison with drills and other **autodiadict** approaches based on virtual materials. 

## Instead of investing anything in your vehicular life ... invest in your virtual AUTODIDACTIC life.

*If there's a vehicle involved in getting to/from it, the content is just not going to be worthwhile.* It's important to understand, for yourself, why that is the case.

Any kind of regular automotive culture indulgence does not tend to just rather mindless in its own construction ... throughout all aspects of my life, I now feel even STUPIDER after traveling to something ... especially when that something proves to be even more worthless than my low expectations of what I expected it to be.  *It is as if people who use vehicles are not only stupid, but they develop antiquated pre-2020 agendas of stupid antiquated happy horseshit that is more endemically, inherently time-wasting, unfocused, less self-aware, meandering CRAP that is even worse than just me searching through my shelves of old books and MUCH WORSE than the efficiency of using AI, web search and knowledge engineering tools like ConnectedPapers.
