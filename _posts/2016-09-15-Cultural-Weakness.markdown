Most [if not all] islamophilic multiculuralists tend to be deliberately, aggressively naive about how something like the *religion of submission* but they cannot ignore how a culture that drives and thrives upon [slavery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnJfR70n6k0).  There are [entitled morons out there who will unabashedly and gladly enslave others](https://youtu.be/Wln6lNTxVpY?t=37m40s) in order to subsidize the grossly inefficient academic industry in America in order to provide higher education for everyone because they claim that higher education is the key to opportunity. They completely fail to realize that a nation FREE of slavery in all its forms, including the tax and regulatory burdens of grossly inefficient state and federal bureaucracies, is THE key to opportunity. [Thomas Sowell is absolutely right about **opportunity**](https://youtu.be/Wln6lNTxVpY?t=38m1s) ... all of us in America have had ample *opportunities* to become the next [Michael Jordan](https://youtu.be/LAr6oAKieHk) or [Miles Davis](https://youtu.be/dou3aSZmEg0?list=PLElrASo3VHBxt9zg3oRoKSqmyiCHct4Ai) ... but ONLY Michael Jordan and Miles Davis WORKED and PERSEVERED [to overcome their own fears, doubts and failures](http://www.michaeldpollock.com/michael-jordan-on-failure-and-perseverance/) or when success looked especially FAR from being certain (eg being and then WORKED and PERSEVERED even more after it appeared that success was possible ... even if we want to IMAGINE that our talent constrains us ... even though we more than enough examples to PROVE that talent, aptitude or any physical attribute [including appearance] is NOT the barrier that most humans want to believe ... we must know that we have had more than sufficient opportunities to WORK and PRACTICE and hone what skills we do have to be able to reach what most regard as impossible goals ... ALL people in America HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY to play on a level where we can interact with supremely-talented masters who have ALSO worked hard in order to take advantage of the opportunities offered to them.  

# Higher education IS NOT the key to opportunity     

The KEY to opportunity is using what opportunities you have to the very fullest as you await being showered with the opportunities that surreptitiously always accrue to those who have a proven history of using the opportunities that they have had.  *If you want opportunities ... then USE the mountain of opportunities you already have.*
