# These annotated reading lists will not include proprietary packages or papers from journals with a pay wall 

We learn from living open source knowledge communities ... learning is not exactly about a factoid we come across in Wikipedia entry, but as the community processes of Wikipedia show, we must learn about how communities are learning and what resources those communities are developing. 

As open sourceists, we are concerned with studying and maybe improving open source learning projects. We look at how it works ... how participants read / review / discuss before they fork / revise / refactor / extend.ing open source knowledge ... as more people participate, the lack of any justification for proprietary, closed-source should either become more obvious to everyone OR otherwise, those associated with proprietary materials will have to add something other than the cachet of overcharging. 

Of course, smarter people now realize why the cost to purchase something has nothing to do with its value or that higher prices are used to trick people who do not bother to research purchases into rationalizing their faulty, unknowledgable evalations of status-driven purchases ... in educational knowledge resources, most of the value does not come from the quality of the printing or the stately campus, but instead comes from being involved some small way with others in building something larger, something that ***extends*** open source for others.

# Introduction / Background

Our interest in the Quantum CloudKernel and a smart cloud, in which information/knowledge is DECENTRALIZED, is driven by our belief that the entire field of computer engineering has essential gotten it wrong ever since someone decided to focus on the CPU, the CENTRAL processing unit.

Our experience in jiujitsu shows us that the sensors/acuators are necessarily where the action is ... and quite possibly, it is the control of muscles, eg to breathe, pump/oxygenate blood, digest food and put nutrients in the bloodstream, is where much of our human ambition, drive, creativity and intelligence is ... the CENTRAL processing unit will never be starved for oxygen or bloodflow -- unless no attention is paid to what delivers the oxygen and bloodflow.
