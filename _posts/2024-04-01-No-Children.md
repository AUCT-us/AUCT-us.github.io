**This is a dead serious topic.** It's one of the most serious. *I am different from and probably even TRY a bit too hard some times to be different than other people -- so April 1 is the ONE day of the year that I am NOT fooling around.  THIS IS NOT A JOKE.*  

# It was not my Creator's will that I NOT have kids.

**The SHORT answer to the question of this title ... and 100% correct answer is that it was my Creator's will that I NOT have kids.**

The ONLY thing that I work at trying to understand is my Creator's will ... I could not care less about the other stuff.  The degree to which I care about anything else is a derivative of my desire to know and understand my Creator's will.  I do not care about my species ... EXCEPT for the fact that my Creator brought me and my species into existence for some reason, that I accept but don't really understand.

I certainly do not understand my Creator's will completely ... but I pay more attention to my Creator's will than anything else in the world and I certainly accept the reasons behind the outcomes of my Creator's will, ie I respect and completely LOVE Reality as really is -- I regard wishes for Reality to be different than Reality really is as being stupid and worse than wrong.  I don't second-guess my Creator's will -- I pray more fervently than anything else that my Creator's will be done, ie being forgiven for my sins or not led astray or recieving enough calories for the day ahead or being free from discomfort is not close to as important to me as the priority of my prayer that my Creator's will be done.

So, over time, the fact that I don't have kids because it has not been my Creator's will has made more and more and more sense to me ... conversely, any of the reasons that any other human has ever given me for having kids has made less and less and less sense to me, to the point where I now regard those reasons as hideously stupid [and generally a reason to sort someone into the "idiot" pile].

It's not my Creator's will that I have children.

Why? I really do not know ... the only clue that I have is that I am much, much happier WITHOUT having to worry about children ... and I am much, much happier knowing that I am not passing down a genetic shortcoming to another generation ... what I have noticed in my OWN life is that the very best things that I recieved from my parents [and grandparents] were not remotely close to being tied to genetics, EXCEPT in the sense of accepting our genetic heritage, eg strong tendencies toward autistic spectral disorders, manic-depression or intestinal disorders/cancers and doing what was necessary to overcome these problems. So should I pass down a problem ... just so another generation has the opportunity to overcome it?  Maybe ... but evidently my Creator has decided that I should not. ***What I do KNOW with total certainty*** is that I am fabulously happy precisely BECAUSE I don't have to bother with entertaining other people or worry about making provisions for a family.*

There are those who tell me that the world would end if everyone thought like me ... which is demonstrably laughable on several levels ... first of all, there are over 8 billion of my species on this planet and it does not appear that there's ANY risk whatsoever that the human population will seriously decline below the point where it has totally subdued all other lifeforms on planet ... secondly, my Creator might not send another flood to erase a species that he has second thoughts about, but there might be something else in store ... maybe the planet and the rest of creation would be better off without human beings ... who know's ... that's not my call ... the Creator's will is what drives this.
