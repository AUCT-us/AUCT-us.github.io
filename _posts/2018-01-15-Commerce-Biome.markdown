The biggest, most revolutionary news is not really being reported that much ... or maybe it is and nobody chooses to pay attention because they want distractions instead of worrying about things that they can actually change in terms of the affect on them ... maybe it's like how people prefer to watch athletes that might play in the Super Bowl or even programs on nutrition, rather than actually doing calisthenics or fasting.

The biggest news affecting the population of humans on this planet involves the digital realm and the importance of that realm has entirely exploded because of the rise of open source technology for everything through open sourced Unix, Linux [and Android] and Git ... now the explosion involves the development communities around things like Kubernetes and  TensorFlow ... these things matter because of the rapidly developing awareness and insight of business intelligence activities is making the economic playing field a lot less level ... largely, because many people almost willfully refuse to pay attention to the digital realm and open source even those these things completely drive the economy.

Most views of economics are wrong; even those who have informed views tend to have views that look at how things worked in the past. But capital does not really matter *that much* any more -- yes, of course, capital still matters somewhat but not in the way that it absolutely dominated economic activity twenty or thirty years ago ... similarly, anyone involved in mfg will tell you that labor costs do not really drive manufacturing costs any more, ie companies don't build mfg plants in Mexico or overseas to escape high labor costs, they do it to escape the stifling inflexibility of unions. Economics evolves, your understanding of economics should evolve. The economy dictates where you work and live, what you have available to eat, when you get up in the morning, what your kids learn in school and who they interact with and who your descendants will be. So, it's always going to be the economy, stupid. But your economy is not about capitalism anymore ... your economy is all about your data and business intelligence, stupid.

The digital economy also matters because the overall state of information security is ***maybe*** getting worse in some things and [teams of hackers are getting enormously more sophisticated at exploiting the typical carelessness or disregard for security that most have](https://www.wired.com/story/worst-hacks-2017/) ... stop wasting your time on the reported news and the daily dose of hysteria -- instead, pay more attention to your data and the digital realm. Start becoming somewhat aware of what is driving the really HEAVY traffic in the open source that are being used for the HEAVY LIFTING in the post-capitalist global information economy because that is where the big money is going to be [and because of THAT, it is also where the criminals, terrorists and evil-doers are going to be].  

The popular, reported, traditional news topics are a complete DISTRACTION ... just as much as NFL football and Netflix are nothing but escapes.  This is not about some conspiracy theory ... the tracking is not just the stuff the NSA or some other government agency Big Brother does ... what really matters is everything ELSE ... everything about our assumptions, perceptions, behaviors, choices, attitudes, psychological precursors that show up in our economic lives or tendencies to purchase.

And it's not just what each of us might be influenced into clicking on or buying but also how much influence we exert over our network of family, friends, professional colleagues and anyone associated with us. Our network is also tracked and analyzed to examine how it might influence broader networks and supply chains.  It's the full commerce collective unconscious biome that is driving a lot of different very smart people ... *the best minds of our generation* ... who are desperately trying to track, analyze, understand what we are going to buy next ... and why ... how that can be changed.
