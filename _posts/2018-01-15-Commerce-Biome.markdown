Linux-Git-Kubernetes-TensorFlow ... stop wasting your time on the news -- instead, pay more attention to the really HEAVY traffic in the open source that are being used for the HEAVY LIFTING in the post-capitalist global information economy... OR, if you don't believe that something bigger than the latest news story is just a bunch of chickenlittle nonsense, do a data detox sometime and pay very close attention to the details of what comes out in a thorough cleanse of YOUR data and you cannot help being amazed by how incredibly tracked, analyzed and herded [with recommendation engines or filtered search results] most of us are ... in other words, the news is a DISTRACTION.  

This is not some conspiracy theory ... the tracking is not just the stuff the NSA or some other government agency Big Brother does ... what really matters is everything ELSE ... everything about our assumptions, perceptions, behaviors, choices, attitudes, psychological precursors that show up in our economic lives or tendencies to purchase. And it's not just what each of us might be influenced into buying but also how much influence we exert over our network of family, friends, professional colleagues and anyone associated with us. Our network is also tracked and analyzed to examine how it might influence broader networks and supply chains.  It's the full commerce collective unconscious biome that is driving a lot of different very smart people ... *the best minds of our generation* ... who are desperately trying to track, analyze, understand what we are going to buy next ... and why ... how that can be changed.

Capital does not really matter that much any more ... in the same way that labor costs don't really drive manufacturing costs any more.  

The economy dictates where you live, what you eat, when you get up in the morning, what you learn in school and who you interact with and who your descendants will be. So, it's always going to be the economy, stupid. But your economy is not about capitalism anymore ... it's all about your data, stupid.
