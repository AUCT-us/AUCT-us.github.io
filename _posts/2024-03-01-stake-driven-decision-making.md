# Terminology backgrounder

The Harberger tax is a property tax that can be implemented through self-assessment and the ability to purchase property at the taxed price. It's also known as Common Ownership Self-assessed Tax (COST). Property owners periodically assess the value of their property and pay tax on their self-assessed value. Anyone can buy the property from the owner at that self-assessed or taxed price at any time. Effectively, self-assessing is equivalent to listing the property for sale; this forces the owner, ie the person with the best knowledge about the property, to carefully and accurately evaluate the true value of their property. The tax is proportional to the selling price and the length of time the deed is held, ie to recognize the value to society of taxes paid in the past and the stability of longer-term property ownership. The tax is intended to improve societal welfare by optimizing the investment and encouraging information-sharing via self-assessments to improve the overall allocative efficiency of all pieces of private property. Harbergeorgism or Harbergeoism, a **combination** of Harberger taxation and ([Georgism or Geoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism)), is one way to organize property rights, land usage, and revenue generation that is advocated in charter cities. The "charter cities" movement is based on [an idea proposed/advocated by economist Paul Romer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264275122003377), where a new city is established within a developing country with the ability to create its own governance system, essentially acting as a "city-state" with unique laws and regulations designed to foster economic growth by attracting investment and talent, often with a focus on pro-business policies and good governance practices, distinct from the surrounding country's system; essentially allowing for experimentation with better governance models in a contained area. Hong Kong, [or the way that Hong Kong formerly operated] often has been cited as a historical example of a city that benefited from a unique economic system with favorable business regulations, which could be seen as a model for charter cities. 

## Brainstorming equitable, fluid democracy systems for stake-driven decision-making

In order to start off our exploration of these topics, we have generated a list of 250 practical implementation questions organized into thematic sections.
