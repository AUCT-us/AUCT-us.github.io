Dodd-Frank COMPLETELY changed my retirement plans ... in a small way, that's okay, I guess ... life SHOULD come along and completely change things for a person; the's the beauty of life.  In a much larger way, though, it is a really bad deal for America, Americans and all those who are allies and friends of Americans ... in a nutshell, [Dodd-Frank has eliminated NEW banking or financial company startup genesis, it has driven banks to merge and consolidate and, unsurprisingly, fewer and larger banks have effective monopolies in some markets boosting their pricing power, so profits of the fewer and larger banks have increased even as customers pay more for a shrinking or stagnant array of services](http://www.wsj.com/articles/dodd-franks-effect-on-small-banks-is-muted-1443993212).

Before Dodd-Frank was passed, I had planned to work like a fiend, save everything I earned, invest diligently and then keep re-investing until I could retire at 59 1/2 [since a large portion of what eventually would be my liquid net worth was in IRA/401(k) accounts] to develop an investment company and start-up accelerator [primarily for fintechs] to encourage others to work, save and invest in startups -- of course that including getting others to start their own small banks and investment companies.  After Dodd-Frank, I decided to retire early, there was no longer a point in saving, I gave away most of my assets [except for enough to cover my expenses and not be destitute] and I decided to "go Galt" writing, doing research, improving my health, preparing for the inevitable COLLAPSE.  So far the collapse has been unfolding in an especially stagnant fashion.

Without a high birthrate of new employer firms ... there is absolutely NO WAY to get the growth that will be necessary to responsibly handle the debt and contingent liabilities our nation as acquired through its copious expansion of entitlements ... a diverse financial ecosystem with robust array of capital alternatives are essential for spurring the birthrate and initial expansion of new employer firms .... Dodd-Frank has killed the goose that laid the golden eggs; look at the disaster it has caused in banking, particularly in small banking and small financial companies -- there's been fewer than a handful of new small banking and small financial companies formed since Dodd-Frank ... I do not see an alternative to an inevitable COLLAPSE, but I believe that sooner would be much better than later ... while there are still people who remember what banking was like before Dodd-Frank, before Sarbanes-Oxley.
