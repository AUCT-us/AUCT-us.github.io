**Government always has a strategy ... because of this, the people need to deploy counter strategies.**   

*If you trust governments, you shouldn't.* 

You *should* trust your basic motives for wanting to believe that governments are there for good purposes like liberty, justice and fighting for the little guy ... but governments are NOT what they promise to be.  You shouldn't really trust anyone or anything, but if you think you NEED to trust something, it'd be better if you trusted the type of people who are involved in a project that helps get past government, like [Open Whisper](https://github.com/whispersystems/).  

IDEALLY, governments are supposed to exist in order to protect rights. Governments only RARELY do this ... they would NEVER EVER EVER do this if not for checks, balances and people holding governments accountable.  That means the goodness of government is entirely up to you ... without YOU holding your government accountable, government is EVIL.

In practice, governments exist to protect the rights of powerful bureaucrats, politicians and tyrants. This is not to say that there are not plenty of plenty who really try hard to make government better, to make it serve the public interest.  NO politician, soldier or bureaucrat has EVER has *absolutely* followed their oath to support and defend the Constitution ... even the ones who actually try can't -- they do the best that they can within the constraints of how government actually operates.

IDEALLY, government leaders are democratically selected.

In practice, MOST adults are so disgusted by government that they RATIONALLY choose not to wait effort voting. Majorities are TERRIBLE ways to make choices -- if you believe otherwise, try being the guy that the majority of the lynch mob wants to hang.

In spite of what the leader of the lynch mob wants the crowd to do, there is almost NEVER an actual need for government to take action ... if the lynch mob wants action and needs government to forcefully, coercively take action, we can say with near certainty that there is a BETTER voluntary solution that makes more sense BECAUSE it is VOLUNTARY and makes obvious sense without needing to HURT the minority that is opposed to the coercive action.  

Democracy IS a great thing IF one realizes that there are severe limits on how large a democracy can be before it becomes a mechanism for corruption and tyranny.  A couple thousand years ago, Plato nailed it -- Plato earnestly believed that the optimal size for a democracy was 5,300 people.  This is about right -- maybe the optimal size human-scale democracy is closer 53,000 but it is definitely not human scale any more at 530,000 or 5.3M or larger.  In other words, if something is a GREAT IDEA ... why isn't it VOLUNTARY ... if you imagine that *voluntary* cannot possibly work for your great idea, WHY does it need the coercive force of MORE than a human-scale 5300-person true democracy.  WHY does your great idea require the corruption and tyrannical power of more than 5300 people?  

If your idea isn't voluntary or requires the industrial coercive strength of more than 5300 people for adoption, there's a good likelihood that your idea is IDIOTIC and DANGEROUS.
