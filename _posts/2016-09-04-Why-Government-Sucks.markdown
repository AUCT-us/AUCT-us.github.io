IDEALLY, governments are supposed to exist in order to protect rights. Governments do not REALLY do this. In practice, governments exist to protect the rights of powerful bureaucrats, politicians and tyrants. NO politician, soldier or bureaucrat has EVER has *absolutely* followed their oath to support and defend the Constitution ... they do the best that they can within the constraints of how government actually operates.

IDEALLY, government leaders are democratically selected. In practice, MOST adults are so disgusted by government that they RATIONALLY choose not to wait effort voting. Majorities are TERRIBLE ways to make choices -- if you believe otherwise, try being the guy that the majority of the lynch mob wants to hang.

In spite of what the leader of the lynch mob wants the crowd to do, there is almost NEVER an actual need for government to take action ... if the lynch mob wants action and needs government to forcefully, coercively take action, we can say with near certainty that there is a BETTER voluntary solution that makes more sense BECAUSE it is VOLUNTARY and makes obvious sense without needing to HURT the minority that is opposed to the coercive action.  

Democracy IS a great thing IF one realizes that there are severe limits on how large a democracy can be before it becomes a mechanism for corruption and tyranny.  A couple thousand years ago, Plato nailed it -- Plato earnestly believed that the optimal size for a democracy was 5,300 people.  This is about right -- maybe the optimal size human-scale democracy is closer 53,000 but it is definitely not human scale any more at 530,000 or 5.3M or larger.
