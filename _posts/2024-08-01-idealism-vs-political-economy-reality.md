# Practical Questions for Cooperative Game Theory in Community Projects

## Resource Allocation and Time Banking

1. How can a time-banking system account for different skill levels while maintaining fairness? Consider a scenario where an expert plumber's hour might provide more value than a novice gardener's hour. What reward / reputation mechanisms might reward skilled people for the contributions, such that there is not an underprovision of highly-skilled expert trainers who instruct in things that are particularly in demand? 

2. What mechanisms could prevent the accumulation of too many time credits by highly skilled members, which might lead to system imbalances?

3. How should seasonal variations in demand for different skills (e.g., gardening in spring vs. home weatherization in fall) be managed within a time-banking system?
