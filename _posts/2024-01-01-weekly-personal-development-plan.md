# 52-Week Personal Development Syllabus

## Week 1: Revisiting Your Time Mgmt Foundations ... Starting With A Serious Self-Assessment Of What's Working And What's Not

1. Re-introduction to calendar scheduling and time blocking

    * There's no need to start over ... or to do something like re-inventing Google calendar app or whatever else you use now; you don't need another swanky app with new features and color-coded doodads to learn ... but you must begin by taking a serious, hard look at what's working **OPTIMALLY** *FOR YOU, in YOUR system.* Getting by isn't good enough ... what's not as OPTIMAL as it could be?
    * You're not a kid -- you have a LIFETIME of experience with project management, goal setting and personaltime management systems ... build on that foundation and re-do the foundation if it's soft.
    * What do you **rely on** now? How well is that method working? Is it just a stale version of what got you by? What was the secret of what made that system work? How could that system work better? 
    * Do you need to change anything? Why? Is everything broken ... or do you just need to get serious about being more consistent? What are the new tricks that an old dog like you should be learning?
    * When you think about your current time management system, what comes to mind in terms of what's not working? Why do you think that? Do you have data and proof? Do you use something like a "Distraction Journal" or "Examen Notebook" to detail what's stopping you from being more consistent?

2. Revisiting the basics of time optimization, goal setting, serious action plans and some form of Plan-Do-Check-Act follow-thru management

3. Revisiting your Big WHY -- how well do you think you understand your personal values for task prioritization? {HINT: You will never understand those personal values well enough, until you are dead. *There's always something more that God has for you to learn*.}

4. Identifying what drives, or what is failing to drive, the focus of your attention in your current attention management practices ... this is what the Examen Journalling is all about for any of those times when you struggle ... and, as we all know, if you are not struggling, you are killing yourself and making your doom more imminent.

5. Recognizing loss of focus or procrastination patterns uncovers symptoms of deeper issues.

    * Procrastination is not likely about willpower or your lack of it.
    * Underlying unresolved issues are generally what drives or are the largest contributor to problems with focus or procrastination.
    * Your lack of a solid connection between task objectives and the big overall WHY of your existence is mostly likely behind the problems driving your procrastination ... that lack of connection is not going to fix itself.

6. Reviewing and re-implementing all of the material that you have learned about written to goal setting and SMART criteria

7. Christian mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) techniques starting with basic breathwork and relaxation techniques ... and then building on the basic **sign of the cross**... it's worth repeating that to emphasize that Christian MBSR is entirely built from the ground up on everything that drives a careful, mindfull **sign of the cross**. 

Start with basic breathwork, either box-breathing methods for diaphagmatic breathing or the “4-7-8” breathing technique … make the **sign of the cross** *mindfully* with extra care, deliberately, slowly, CAREFULLY.

As you make the sign, you will also be doing a coordinated 4-7-8 breath cycle ... after you have developed the habit, it will become comforting ... because it's all about our love of God.

First, a four-count deep, quick, huge inhale (as you touch your forehead) - then, a seven-count holding of the breath (as you touch your heart) - and finally, an eight count exhale (as you touch each shoulder). Coordinate your breathing cycle with your physical motions and your intentional prayer … so don't just say it or go through the motion, but intentionally PRAY the sign of the cross ... starting with the four-count INHALE, as you mentally express gratitude for ALL of your blessings, IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER … then, holding your breath for seven counts, you will contemplate the fullness of the mysteries of Jesus Christ, dwelling on the suffering and sacrifice … you wrap up the cycle as do a final eight-count long exhale as you contemplate the meaning of Resurrection, the new Creation and everything thereafter through the Holy Spirit and the expansion of the faithful through the church and celebration of the sacrements.

As you breathe, you should notice how your diaphram pushes your belly out to fully engage in mediatative diaphagmatic breathing. Diaphramatic breathing is foundation of meditative breathing techniques, so you must have a grounding in diaphramatic breathing before wasting time prematurely moving on to the basic MBSR body scan meditation, followed perhaps by Hatha yoga and postures that help you to relax and breathe more deeply, then move on to guided meditation [via something like the Hallow app or similar], then experiment on your own with longer forms of meditation which work for you. Prayerwalking [without audio distractions] is one thing that might helpful, going to daily mass and arriving early to spend time in prayer beforehand might be something else to try. Experiment … but, above all, give these things some repititions and TIME for them to work … use a charitable mindset to encourage results, ie at first, fake it, until you make it; but there’s no need to beat a dead horse … just be a little patient*.

Re-establish your connection to your Catholic religious practices and the larger community of the faithful who share your appreciation for Catholic traditions. Don’t just go to daily mass, but pray the rosary and explore other ways to deepen your faith and grow in your relationship with the larger body of believers.
