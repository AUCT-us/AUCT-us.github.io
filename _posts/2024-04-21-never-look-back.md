### Research, Methods and Peer-Reviewed Publication of Findings

#### Quantitative, Qualitative, and Mixed Methods Research Designs

By the end of five modules, students will have had a deep exposure to the statistical foundations and experimental design principles that underlie rigorous and reproducible research in the social and health sciences. They will be equipped with the very basics of the comprehensive toolkit for future Just-In-Time investigation as specific needs arise of traditional and cutting-edge research methods, as well as an basic understanding of the practical skills needed to conduct and publish high-quality research in an increasingly pre-print-driven digital and open scientific ecosystem.

* Interactive Dashboards, Web Applications, Rentable Compute (eg Paperspace, GCP Collab, etc.)

* Independent Research Project Repositories and Research Ecoystems (eg PapersWithCode)

* Research Portfolio, Social Media, Outreach Dissemination Strategies

Throughout these five modules, students will been encouraged to engage in their own hands-on data analysis, experimental design, and research projects that apply advanced statistical methods and innovative research tools to real-world problems in medicine, psychology, and economics. The curriculum emphasizes an EXTREMELY BROAD OVERVIEW ... **to give perspective** ... in the development of critical thinking, scientific integrity, and collaborative research skills, as well as the ability to effectively communicate and disseminate research findings to diverse audiences. The point these modules is NOT to make a student proficient in any one area ... that proficiency will develop when they actually use tools ... the POINT is to give them a very general understanding of the DIFFERENT statistical tools and experimental research designs methods available, and the types of things that obscured by using the wrong tool ... which is USUALLY DONE to make the data agree with the funding authority [or future funding sources].

#### Presentation of Research Results and Integrative Webinar/Podcast

Throughout the course, students will have engaged in a combination of resources and hands-on experiential learning activities that integrate theological, psychological, and neuroscientific perspectives on aging, dementia, alcoholism, and coping mechanisms. The curriculum emphasizes the development of critical thinking, empathy, and pastoral care skills, as well as the ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world contexts.

By the end of this intensive program, students will have a deep understanding of the complex interplay between spiritual, emotional, and cognitive factors that shape the aging process and its associated challenges. They will be equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to provide effective pastoral care, counseling, and support to older adults and their families, as well as to develop innovative ministries and programs that promote successful aging, resilience, and spiritual well-being.

The course also places a strong emphasis on the ethical, social, and theological implications of aging and end-of-life issues, as well as the importance of fostering a supportive and inclusive community that values the wisdom, dignity, and contributions of older adults. Through a combination of academic rigor, practical application, and personal reflection, this curriculum provides a comprehensive foundation for Christian leaders and scholars who seek to address the challenges and opportunities of an aging society.
