Throughout the course, students will engage in a combination of lectures, seminars, case studies, and experiential learning activities that integrate theological, psychological, and neuroscientific perspectives on aging, dementia, alcoholism, and coping mechanisms. The curriculum emphasizes the development of critical thinking, empathy, and pastoral care skills, as well as the ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world contexts.

By the end of this intensive program, students will have a deep understanding of the complex interplay between spiritual, emotional, and cognitive factors that shape the aging process and its associated challenges. They will be equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to provide effective pastoral care, counseling, and support to older adults and their families, as well as to develop innovative ministries and programs that promote successful aging, resilience, and spiritual well-being.

The course also places a strong emphasis on the ethical, social, and theological implications of aging and end-of-life issues, as well as the importance of fostering a supportive and inclusive community that values the wisdom, dignity, and contributions of older adults. Through a combination of academic rigor, practical application, and personal reflection, this curriculum provides a comprehensive foundation for Christian leaders and scholars who seek to address the challenges and opportunities of an aging society.
