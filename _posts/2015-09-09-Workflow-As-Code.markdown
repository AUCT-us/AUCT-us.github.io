[Culture](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/03/13/culture-why-its-the-hottest-topic-in-business-today/) should be an important topic because organizational culture drives organization output.  How can we enable the [most healthy, most enjoyable, MOST PRODUCTIVE customer-centric culture](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664) ... and after we do that, how do we make it even BETTER?  

The practical experience of the most successful emergent up-and-coming firms on the planet right now, such as [Netflix](http://techblog.netflix.com/) or [GitHub](https://youtu.be/2fBNuK6CRmA?t=54m46s) or Airbnb or Uber or any emergent company you want to pick, suggest that a better, more dynamic and antifragile culture is NOT a matter of diversity quotas or cool perks or quirky policy or any nice little participation ribbon tied to some secondary or tertiary initiative that was allowed to pollute the work environment ... the most important thing about a better culture is customer-driven focus ... that means that everyone must respect and serve the central mission of the organization with an expectation of performance and delivery on SMART objectives that are aligned to the customer-driven focus ... a better culture comes with the freedom and responsibility to build personal and professional independence and to be able to move on to something that serves customers even better.  

It is about lean thinking, seeing waste and designing the non-value-added distractions out of the equation and optimizing the flow past the constraints in our systems and our workflow.   A better FLOW of work that has become practically achievable by understanding that all knowledge work is a matter of programming and the opportunity to automate a better workflow with extensible software systems -- there are lessons from the [professional use of Git distributed version-control database technology](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and the development of extensible, open source software that apply to EVERY business with a future.  

The Git story is one that particularly worth understanding.  Git software didn't exist just a little 10 years ago; it was created for the Linux kernel, but Git's impact will probably be larger than Linux -- because of how Git provides for distributed, decentralized team workflows for geographically-dispersed teams.  Although Git might have emerged from a particular software development need, it is very important to understand that the uses for Git are not just about software ... Git will change the workflow of ANYONE doing ANY kind knowledge work [if it hasn't already].  Beyond just geography or physical barriers, why couldn't a a technology like Git [and Git host like Github, tools like Gitter] by changing the workplace and workflows help diversify workflows and really change things like the fact that **[only one in ten open source contributors are women](https://www.os4w.org/)**?  *Why do we need to tolerate cultures that perpetuate that kind of problem any more?*

Let's start by thinking about how a Git workflow radically changes or completely ELIMINATES meetings it is important to think about what that means for a culture of more diverse, geographically-distributed professionals who WERE unable for good reasons (eg, childcare, care of an elderly parent) to participate in meetings before.  If we think about that long enough, we start realizing deeper reasons for WHY the meetings are now unnecessary [except for the comfort of dinosaurs].  Git-centric conversations about writing/editing/issues in using code/content in repositories gravitate toward a continually transcripted chat-driven 24x7 conversation which does not need to interrupt the other work and mental focus of participants.  The technology of these Git chats includes handy and extensible repository-centric chat tools like Gitter for keeping everyone in the conversation focused on the same issue.  Moreover, the urls for each conversation node in the transcript eliminate the annoying "He said/She said" games that get played with flawed recollections of verbal meetings.  For chats and reasons related to the [codegraphs of contributions and other activity](https://help.github.com/categories/graphs-and-contributions/), Git is also changing the way that professionals and professional teams are managed [because everyone can see who is doing what when; team structures get a lot flatter and there's less room for politics or *weasel*] ... beyond that, a Git portfolio or GitHub [professional profile](https://help.github.com/articles/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile-page/) also changes the way those professionals develop their resumes and *advertise* their body of or work or **[commits](https://help.github.com/categories/commits/)** to repositories which represent their collaborative work history.

Github [the largest host of Git repositories] provides for a common, standardized, hyper-efficient Git workflow ... the Github workflow is so efficient because it applies seamlessly as developers or authors switch to OTHER open source projects and other teams that are using GitHub ... Github has had a GIGANTIC impact on software development in the last five years and this impact is expanding ... all kinds of knowledge workers who write books or develop any kind of content collaboratively are moving to Git and Github  ... it is worth reading the account of Github's rise on Wired magazine to understand the larger significance of what [Github](http://www.wired.com/tag/github/) is about.

With Git all authors participating in a project have version-controlled copies of the entire project repository [or repositories] on their own local machines.  Git manages the edits/revisions while providing full tracking of exactly who did what to the code or text document ... Git also retains all branches or forks -- ALL of the creation/edit/revision/merge history is there, so there don't have to be any worries about deletions or unwanted changes.  This allows for COMFORTABLY adopting a radically decentralized, distributed workflow for dispersed teams as well as meshing people with unconventional schedules (eg nightowls collaborating with early-risers and normal people with 9-to-5 jobs who code after hours).

It is important to reiterate that Github is ONLY one host of open source Git databases ... there are other hosts, but there are very solid reasons why Github has rapidly become the largest host using the Git software, not all of those reasons are in the Wired article -- one BIG reason is GitHub's CIO Scott Chacon, [how incredibly deep Chacon's knowledge of Git was](https://youtu.be/ZDR433b0HJY) years before anyone else's AND how hard Chacon is now driving Github now to increase the depth of its knowledge of Git even further by looking at how GitHub users break the system with edge cases, boundary conditions, runaway code and all sorts of unique issues that pop up on the radar screen of a host with Github's scale ... it's not just that Github is getting better at hosting Git; Git is getting better, too.  The Git software that is used for these databases is itself an open source project and there are plenty of other Git hosts who can step in if Github falters or changes. It is also important to understand WHY the Git open source software is not standing still.  The scale of Github and its involvement in the open source Git project are driving Git to improve and "grind the rough edges off" -- the immense scale and scope in the usage profile is pushing Git to mature into a SIMPLER software package!   

If you want to learn more about Git, the best resource is Chacon's book, [ProGit2](https://github.com/progit/progit2) ... it's available as a free download for Kindle (mobi) or Apple iBooks (epub) or PDF or HTML5 or ... the full source of ProGit2 [prior to publishing] is available as [the ProGit2 GitHub repo](https://github.com/progit/progit2) if anyone wants to write a better book or one more well-tailored to their particular needs.  The GitHub guys really "eat their own dog food" when it comes to their fanatical belief in open source and transforming workflows with Git ... and their philosophical freeopensourcedness of "giving it all away" has probably caused a lot journos, experts and other dinosaurs to dismiss how big of a deal GitHub is ...

It is very important to understand that Github and Git are not just about software ... those technologies apply to all kinds of knowledge work AND they are extensible, open source technologies that will continue to get better if we master them and make them better.  We need to understand that stupid, unproductive cultures are not just about failing to recognize people's contributions or somehow hurting the feelings of productive people.  The backward cultures that we now settle for are not just about failing to be kind [although that is bad enough], those cultures are costing us because they are about failing to accelerated the development of [MORE healthy, MORE enjoyable, MORE PRODUCTIVE, MORE customer-centric cultures](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664).
