**The best way to criticize is to CREATE.**  

Evil competes every day ... evil won't ever quit.  Defeating evil is up to you. If you want to defeat evil, work at [creating a PRODUCTIVE community of tool developers building everything from email, chat, git repo apps, research notebooks or data analytics tools, torrent clients and robots for different ways to collaborate](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron)!

**The best way to fight or compete is to create and collaborate.  There are opportunities everywhere.  ATTACK the problems! ATTACK the opportunities! ATTACK things that are HARD to do! Help others ATTACK!  The best way to attack is to create!**
