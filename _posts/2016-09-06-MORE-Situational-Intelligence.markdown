**The best way to criticize is to CREATE.  To create, observe and mimic nature.**  You cannot spend too much time outdoors, not just in the smoking area behind your building or an urban courtyard [which isn't that different than huddling outside to take a drag off of a cigarette] ... BE really outdoors, with your bare feet on the earth, observing nature, as part of nature, looking at how nature creates.  

Creativity is like soil building ... not at all simple, even though people like to imagine that it is.  Creativity is a way of understanding cycles and rhythms, bot cut through noise. Understanding value and achieving a cleaner signal yields simplicity and sustainability.  If humans want to create, they should avoid their fixation on biased, complicated human policy models and instead imitate how [natural] creation achieves simplicity. This means shepherding reasonable complex interactions involving plants, fungi, bacteria, insects and animals ... basically a matter of pulling the weeds.

The entropy or noise of the universe is constantly increasingly in several different dimensions. If you want to defeat noise or minimize entropy, you must understand cycles and rhythms in order to work at [creating a PRODUCTIVE community of tool developers building everything to make people independently creative ... everything from email, chat, git repo apps, research notebooks, CAD tools, collaborative data analytics tools, torrent clients, gaming/simulation software and streaming robots for different ways to collaborate](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron)!

**The best way to fight or compete is to create and collaborate.  There are opportunities everywhere.  ATTACK the problems! ATTACK the opportunities! ATTACK things that are HARD to do! Help others ATTACK!  The best way to attack is to create!**
