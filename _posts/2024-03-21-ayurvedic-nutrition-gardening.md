I am not at all interested in dwelling on symptoms, regular diagnostic screenings or using approaches that rely on medicating problems away, although this is precisely the form of mass [hypochrondriasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochondriasis) that is endemic in affluent culture ... even if you turn off your television, you will still be bombarded by the marketing departments of large health organizations as you turn 65 and suddenly become a LEAD for someone health org trying to SELL you something that only sick people need. 

*I detest the idolatry of sickness culture and preventative screenings and mass [hypochrondriasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochondriasis) in American culture* ... I thought I didn't care for it when I was in my 50s, but now that I am turning 65, ***ABSOLUTELY detest the diagnostic-driven marketing of [hypochrondriasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochondriasis) in American culture*** because the damned sales blizzards are so INESCAPABLE ... and **completely unnecessary.**

I am mostly interested in a prayer-centric approach to lifestyle practices which include exercise, martial arts training, yoga, meditation, as well as gardening and landscaping in order to incorporate dietary changes and herbal remedies. The whole point of wellness programs should be to involve people in the processes that work for them for becoming healthier and more fit. 

BECOMING more fit and healthier is a matter of building a progressively stronger and stronger base ... instead of taking your health for granted, you have to work at being just slightly healthier and slightly more fit today in order in order to be able to work harder tomorrow at getting just ever so slightly even more healthier, even slightly more fit tomorrow ... you cannot train for any SERIOUS activity [and life, especially life after 65, gets to be pretty damned serious] without expecting that you will need to train seriously for decades.

Building up our health is ... sort of like building up a three legged stool ... we really need body health, mind/emotional health and spiritual health or our whole approach to building better health will be unstable ... but the three-legged stool metaphor is woefully incomplete. We also need to working on our relationships and communities as well as our creativity/art or scientific contributions. 

We need to focus what we are doing NOW to really give it the attention necessary to do it right. For example, when we do martial arts drills, we are focused on one tiny particular aspect of our jiu jitsu game ... our mind cannot be elsewhere  ... in fact, when we can be lost in a state of flow, we might almost be happy from the endorphins released from a great day of getting one teensy aspect right ... but our jiujitsu game is not going to be very good if we are not also working on all kinds of other things and integrating those things. This is even more true with our health and fitness ... we need FOCUS and INTEGRATION as well as a big picture STRATEGIC 360 degree awareness.

# Priorities

Building up our health is about ***diligently applying*** the 7 Pillars of Inspiration, Movement, Cleanse, Connections, Peace, Sleep, Nutrition, and  ... there's no particular correct ORDER to these, but, personally, I try to think about them in THIS order, with THIS priority ... my own prioritization is based on my attempt to correct my own tendencies to place too much priority on food; in other words, if I'm not careful, I usually start off by my thinking by looking at what's in the refrigerator, then maybe if I feel drowsy, I'll take a nap ... I don't really need to place a higher priority sleep and nutrition, my interests will tend to take me there.

YOUR priorities will be different, but you will need to be aware of your own tendencies and assess your priorities accordingly for balance.

## Inspiration

Our SOULS cannot thrive unless we are engaged in prayer as we are SPIRITUALLY creative, SPIRITUALLY productive and inspired to KNOW OUR WHY ... which only comes from spending more time contemplating the will of one's Creator.

The root cause of most wastes of time, money and effort ... the root causes of almost all stress is the **abject spiritual poverty** driven by the constantly advertising, sales and marketing of the kind of depraved materialist existence that is prevalent in American culture. The spiritual poverty is so bad, that people literally REFUSE to take the time acknowledging how bad their addiction to the materialist idol worship of their culture is causing them to lose their souls.

*Who cares if people are good at optimizing, when they are optimizing stupid shiny trailer trash shit and completely ignoring what richness is most valuable across all eternities?*

It doesn't matter how much one optimizes vehicle ... it's still going to ROB its owner of $25,000/year in money, but the robbery will be worse in terms of of the value of time spent in that vehicle ... and as a result of embracing automotive culture, people tend to be completely unable to walk and their muscoskeletal systems atrophies from lack of use ... but it is the time WASTED in the vehicle that is the problem ... the time spent in the vehicle is time that could be spent in prayer, meditation, yoga, martial arts, gardening, landscaping, cooking, reading, writing, painting, playing music, or doing something else that is SPIRITUALLY creative and SPIRITUALLY productive and inspires one to spend more time contemplating the will of one's Creator.

### In summary, meditate on the parallels ... between atrophy of our souls and atrophy of our muscoskeletal system

It might not be a perfect metaphor ... but it might be the best one we have ... these parallels are like a parable from Jesus.

Maybe, the importance of spiritual poverty THROUGH ATROPHY OF OUR PRAYER LIVES is not clear ... so let’s delve into how an automotive culture leads to [musculoskeletal atrophy](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22310-muscle-atrophy) ... *without getting too preachy about this topic,* if we think about it even a little bit, we see the idolatry given to materialist wealth or the ambition devoted solely to the pursuit of wealth, power or fame is EVEN WORSE when it comes to the havoc wreaked upon one's soul by the diminished focus on one's prayer life ... PRAYER is the VEHICLE we can use for being with our Creator, for discerning the will of our Creator in our lives.

Remember, **the ATROPY of the musculoskeletal system due to automotive culture is a metaphor for the atrophy of the soul caused by immmersion in a hyper-materialist affluent culture** ... the atrophy of the soul is the root cause of most spiritual angst and emotional stress ... the atrophy of the soul is actually the root cause of most of the problems that people have with their health and fitness. If you want to be more healthy and more fit, you need to WORK HARDEST on being more spiritually healthy and more spiritually fit ... physical/mental/emotional health will be a natural consequence of spiritual health.

### A Sedentary Lifestyle Is Better Than A Sedentary Prayer Life

In an automotive culture, people often rely heavily on cars for transportation. This sedentary lifestyle reduces physical activity.
When we don’t use our muscles enough, a phenomenon known as disuse atrophy occurs. This means that the muscles start to break down, leading to a decrease in size and strength.

Muscles that are not actively engaged become weaker over time, contributing to atrophy.

### Limited Physical Activity Is Better Than A Limited Prayer Activity

Driving, especially for long periods, involves minimal physical effort. The repetitive motion of sitting and steering doesn’t challenge our muscles.

Lack of regular exercise and movement can cause muscle fibers to shrink and weaken.

### Reduced Weight-Bearing Activities Are Better Than A Limited Weight-Bearing In Prayer

You NEED the positive stress or eustress of weight-bearing activities.

Walking, cycling, or using public transportation involve weight-bearing activities that engage various muscle groups.

In contrast, driving doesn’t provide the same level of resistance or load on muscles.
Weight-bearing exercises are essential for maintaining bone density and muscle strength.

### Physical Postural Impacts Are Insignificant Compared With A Poor Prayer Posture

Prolonged sitting in a car can lead to poor posture. Slouching or maintaining an unnatural position can strain muscles and ligaments.

Muscles that support the spine, such as the erector spinae, may weaken due to lack of use.

### Loss of Bone Density Is Insignificant Compared With Loss of One's Spiritual Density

Bones also suffer from disuse. Weight-bearing activities stimulate bone remodeling and help maintain bone density.
Reduced weight-bearing due to excessive reliance on cars can lead to osteopenia (reduced bone density) and even osteoporosis (severe bone loss).

### Neglect of Active Commuting Is Trivial in Comparison to Neglect of One's Soul

In an automotive culture, walking or cycling for commuting purposes becomes less common.

Active commuting not only benefits cardiovascular health but also engages leg muscles and promotes bone health.

### Neurogenic Atrophy Is Trivial in Comparison to Atrophy Of One's Soul

Neurogenic atrophy occurs when nerves connecting to muscles are damaged or dysfunctional.

While not directly related to automotive culture, it highlights the importance of nerve-muscle communication.

Lack of movement can affect nerve signaling and contribute to muscle atrophy1.

### In summary, meditate on the parallels

Our bodies CANNOT thrive UNLESS we keep them moving! ***Our SOULS cannot thrive unless we are engaged in prayer as we are SPIRITUALLY creative, SPIRITUALLY productive and inspired to KNOW OUR WHY ... which only comes from spending more time contemplating the will of one's Creator.***

## Peace

It's important to ditch all addictions, not only to things like alcohol, but also to people who use alcohol to manage stress.  Beyond that, people who are addicted to material desires really need to left to pursue their addiction on their own, **without your tacit approval.**

This is really about REDUCTION or ELIMINATION of NEGATIVE STRESS.  We want positive stress or eustress in our lives.

But when it comes to negativity ... peace is all about **what stress you can REMOVE** ... if you want peace, you need to forgive, forget and IGNORE the causes of stress ... it's absolutely essential to need to ELIMINATE relationships or activities that are inherently drama magnets or negative stress multipliers.

The best way is to address the ROOT CAUSE of problems ... and set things in order to be extremely low or no maintenance. If you cannot REMOVE your use of a vehicle, then you will need to maintain it ... but it is best to aim for things that infinitely sustainable or will live without any human intervention. The BEST example that you have of infinite sustainability is the soil in your own garden. Take extra time to learn about soil quality and things like [mycorrhizal networks and interactions with other soil life](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1749461312000048) tol assess the living soil ecosystem and soil life interactions in your intended garden area to understand ways that soil quality improvment is conducive to healthy plant growth ... if the opportunity presents itself, you could volunteer with an herbal medicine gardener to gain hands-on experience and practical skills.... if you want to spread peace, you can participate in/lead workshops or courses that teach practical gardening techniques in combination with meditation, yoga, tai chi, breathwork and a knowledge of what it takes to constantly improve the health of your prayer life, ie the root cause of most stress is abject spiritual poverty of materialist existences prevalent in American culture.

Developing a syllabus for stress reduction is mostly about learning to approach ALL forms of learning with an open but skeptical mind, with patience and perseverance and a need to APPLY the knowledge practically, to test one's understanding and see what works in an infinitely sustainable manner. It might be most beneficial to choose those courses and resources which feature a hands-on approach and provide opportunities for personal application and coaching.


## Sleep 

The most important part of getting good rest or applying good sleep hygiene is about **what you REMOVE.**

Get rid of the television or any device that has a screen for scrolling through videos or social media ... there are those who will tell you that you should turn off audio, but the most important thing is to turn off any kind of audio or sounds that makes you think, even if those sounds are coming from your house or noisy pickups going down your street.  There's less of a problem listening to a favorite voice-over artist re-tell a familiar story about the [Battle of Chancellorsville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chancellorsville) in the Civil War OR [Hannibal] commanding the forces of [ancient Carthage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Carthage) against the Romans in the [Battle of Cannae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cannae) in the [Second Punic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Punic_War) ... the real point here is to find a way to make sure there's no light in the room, to either turn off the noise pollution in your head or replace it with ambient sounds ... to sleep well, it's important to do what is necessary to knock out anything that demands attention span, like either scrolling videos that are so addictive OR endlessly thinking about the work you will need to do tomorrow.

## Nutrition

In order to bolster your mental/emotional health, you will need to turn off television and videos, in order to read significantly more.When you read, you need to test and apply. You will want to [autodidactically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism) develop your own customized long-term program of study ... which is mostly going to involve lists of materials to read ... at first, this is about using available content such as Wikipedia, Pubmed and Arxiv and BioRxiv first ... you can also spend relatively tiny amounts of time/money [relative to how much time/$ people spend on their automobiles] on things like ConnectedPapers, Scribd, KindleUnlimited, Audible, Perlego ... in order to advance your physical health most rapidly, you will need to rely upon subscriptions to Gracie University or Rickson Academy or other online materials that are about training after 65.  

Read books such as "Ayurveda, a life of balance by Maya Tiwari" for an introduction to Ayurvedic nutrition, food charts, and recipes OR use KindleUnlimited to read books like [How to Grow Your Own Medicine](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVDTPGZC). Study topics like on the 7 Pillars of Ayurveda (Nutrition, Cleanse, Movement, Sleep, Connections, Inspiration, Peace) ... so that you are able to think for yourself about how you might apply this knowledge **practically**.

Your reading and training in the martial arts will give you the foundational basis for fitness-centric or health-centric dietary principles in nutrition, gardening, food preservation/fermentation and cooking.

You can study the cultivation of mushrooms or medicinal plants and learn how to grow them in harmony with nature’s seasonal rhythms. You can volunteer at a hospice where cancer patients and families go to be together as the patient is dying. You can explore permaculture principles and landscape architecture to develop a sustainable, harmonious, quiet prayer garden.

Gain a BROAD understanding of herbs ... you could approach this by looking at tables of contents, skimming some material, possibly doing a deep dive in one facet of interest ... do this SERIOUSLY, as if you would would want to be aware of the lay of the land if some day your life depends upon it ... you could approach it almost as if you were **possibly** almost considering postgraduate studies in Ayurveda or Traditional Chinese Medicine or Native American herbal medicine ... EXCEPT, that unless you actually do pursue a postgraduate professional study, there's no need to actually ***persist*** in your deep dive ... in fact, nowadays, the beauty of AI and information heavy equipment like Wikipedia that continue to develop ... a jack-of-all-trades general awareness or BROAD understanding is best. 

[Unless you want to work in this area] you can engage as if you were going to become a full-time student in courses designed for practitioners, nutritionists, dieticians, chefs/cooks ... in other words, look at the syllabi and tables of content ... you want a BROAD view, which you can deepen later with the JIT use of AI inference engine on your phone ... so, at first, you just want to approach this as someone with no money to spend, but very interested in SHOPPING FOR IDEAS about more healthy cooking and picking up a few nutrition insights. Don't worry about learning it all at once. BECOMING more fit and healthier is a matter of building a progressively stronger and stronger base OVER TIME ... in order to gain a deeper understanding, you will need to be work on the most pressing matters first, but otherwise be patient and persistent in the long-term application of what you have learned as you change your base.
