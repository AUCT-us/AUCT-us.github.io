You could ask Google Gemini Advanced to [give you a listing of the top 100 advertisers in the most recent Super Bowl ranked by amount of money spent advertising during the game or halftime?](https://gemini.google.com/app/2489055275224dfe) ... and like with most AI BULLSHIT ANSWERS, you will get kind of a pathetic half-assed response ... but since Google's whole buisness model is based on advertising, Gemini is REALLY not going to give you a straight answer ... but, in spite of all the problems, the answer is still good enough.

The REASON is that ... unless you have an absolutely compelling reason to actually use an advertiser who appeals to the lowest-common-denominator, stupidest, half drunk, easily manipulated, likely bored and basically captive audience [surrounded by others who are DRUNK at a Super Bowl function they sorta had to attend, but didn't really want to] ... UNLESS you have defensible reason to use a Super Bowl advertiser, ***you should make an disciplined attempt to avoid those advertisers and all of their products like the dangerous plague upon humanity that those advertisers are.

It's pretty easy FOR SOBER, CRITICALLY-THINKING, INDEPENDENTLY-MINDED to understand why this is true, when we carefully examine the nature of the products being advertised ... and ask ourselves, "WHY are they trying to be especially clever and to garner extra attention ... when their product/service ON ITS OWN MERITS so miserably fails to have any justification whatsoever for people opting to consume these POISONS.

*WHY DON'T THE PRODUCTS JUST SELL THEMSELVES?*

Of course, the answer is, particularly for the products of Super Bowl advertisers, is that that the products are TERRIBLE and even bad for you to consume, that the cannot begin to sell themselves on their merits.

## UNDERSTAND why advertisement works to harvest ALL of the ADDICTS availalble money.

LOOK at the trends ... NOTICE the pattern ... it's not hard to connect the dots when you are actually paying attention.

These following industries traditionally ALWAYS HAVE TO shell out the most during the Super Bowl ... poison vendors HAVE TO do it this way... because their POISON advertisments live rent-free in the brains of POISON ADDICTS passively watching entertainment:

* Empty-calorie, pathologically ADDICTIVE beverages: Anheuser-Busch InBev (Bud Light, Budweiser, Michelob Ultra, etc.), PepsiCo, Coca-Cola

* IMPOVERSISHING automotive products that make people both poorer and generally less fit: General Motors, Toyota, Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler), Kia 

* RECURRENT SUBSCRIPTIONS that people tend to forget about OR over-use in tech and streaming services: Amazon Prime, Google, Netflix, Disney+/ESPN, etc.

* SUBSTANDARD, SECOND-RATED movies and entertainment that suck ... the kind of stuff that people will not particulary remember and just generally would be better off never watching, especially from major movie studios hyper-promoting upcoming releases and entertainment from the likes Universal, Warner Bros, etc that tend to UNDERWHELM and DISAPPOINT, rather than the kinds of content that spreads by word-of-mouth directly from individual REAL PEOPLE who actually were MOVED to make a recommendation TO HELP THEIR FRIENDS.

* ENGINEERED-TO-BE-ADDICTIVE snacks and ulta-processed quasi-edible garbage : Doritos, M&Ms, and other snack giants.

The companies selling stuff that you are stupid for consuming are not idiots ... they KNOW that those advertisements work to get idiots to buy the POISON.  


If you consume ANYTHING from a company that advertises during the Super Bowl, you really need to RETHINK your consumption habits.  

But ... just in case, you needed any clarification ... the list of Super Bowl advertisers should confirm your list of what kinds of POISONS TO AVOID AT ALL COST.

## It's not JUST the POISONs, but the POISON ADDICTS

It's not JUST that we don't watch Super Bowl advertisements ... it's not JUST that we avoid Super Bowl advertisers like the plague they are ... **WE minimize the time we spend with any POISON ADDICTS who consumes any of these kinds of POISONS** ... you cannot get ADDICTS away from defensive over-consumption of their POISONS ... you don't exactly need to shun them or give up on them, but you can cease to stop EVER giving them any affirmation their decision to poison themselves is OK with you ... 

You can just ***politely*** tell them something like, *"Nah, thanks for the invitation and I do appreciate the invitation, but I've totally tapered off my consumption of X and if you have me there while you're swallowing X, I'll be reminding you of the fact that you're a LOSER ADDICT who is poisoning yourself and everyone around you."*
