# Avoid Super Bowl Advertisers Like the Plague They Are

LOOK at the trends ... NOTICE the patterns ... it's not hard to connect the dots or understand the tendencies that advertisers are attempting to foster when you start actually paying attention to what is happening and WHY these POISON consumption patterns have to be reinforced with clever advertising.  Do your own homework. PAY ATTENTION to how it works!

If you wanted to start diving into this topic, you might start with a question of Google Gemini Advanced or a request to [give you a listing of the top 100 advertisers in the most recent Super Bowl ranked by amount of money spent advertising during the game or halftime](https://gemini.google.com/app/2489055275224dfe).

The answer that you get back is ONLY the starting point ... and as with most BULLSHIT ANSWERS we get from different AI chat utilities, you will get kind of a pathetically-lame, half-assed response that will make you roll your eyes in disbelief ... but, then again, since Google's whole buisness model is based on advertising, Gemini is REALLY not going to give you a straight answer ... but, it does not matter.

In spite of all the problems, the pathetic AI answer is still good enough ... because we all basically KNOW the answer to the REAL question, which is ...  

# *BUT WHY DON'T THESE PRODUCTS JUST SELL THEMSELVES?*

Of course, the answer to that question ...  particularly for the products of Super Bowl advertisers ... is that that the products really rely upon CLEVER advertisement ... to CAPTIVE, possibly BORED audiences [trapped at SuperBowl parties people wish they'd stay away from] ... as opposed to JIT key-words-based ads that comes with search engines or the ads that are fed from recommendation engines based on interests/trends in activies.  

SuperBowl ad products are NEVER for something that you were already interested in or trying to find ... those ads are for CAPTIVE, bored, PASSIVE audiences ... not for people ACTIVE searching for something they need.

The products that rely on clever SuperBowl mega-media advertisement are absolutely TERRIBLE for you to consume ... they are POISONS that cannot begin to sell themselves on their own merits or a careful cost/benefit analysis.

## UNDERSTAND why mega-media advertisement works to harvest ALL of the ADDICT population's availalble income

LOOK at the trends ... NOTICE the pattern ... it's not hard to connect the dots when you are actually paying attention to what kinds of advertisements are useful in helping you find some obscure thing you need or some trusted source has told you about.

These following industries traditionally ALWAYS HAVE TO shell out the most during the Super Bowl ... poison vendors HAVE TO do it this way... because their POISON advertisments live rent-free in the brains of POISON ADDICTS passively watching entertainment:

* Empty-calorie, pathologically ADDICTIVE beverages: Anheuser-Busch InBev (Bud Light, Budweiser, Michelob Ultra, etc.), PepsiCo, Coca-Cola

* IMPOVERSISHING automotive products that make people both poorer and generally less fit: General Motors, Toyota, Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler), Kia 

* RECURRENT SUBSCRIPTIONS that people tend to forget about OR worse, end up over-using to justify the big annual subscription ... in tech and streaming services: AmazonPrime, YouTubePremium, Netflix, Disney+/ESPN, etc.

* SECOND-RATE, SUBSTANDARD movies and entertainment that just sucks on the material's own [lack of] merit ... advertisers need to hype the kind of stuff that people will not particulary remember and just generally would be better off never watching ... especially bigger-budget, celebrity content from top-heavy, high overhead movie studios who rely on things like Super Bowl advertisements to hyper-promoting upcoming releases and entertainment ... the likes of Disney, Universal, Warner Bros, Paramount, et al that tend to produce MAJOR disappointments and BRAZENLY open mainstream "active measures" propaganda advocating irresponsible lifestyle choices that degrade cultures... rather than the kinds of indie content that spreads by word-of-mouth directly from individual REAL PEOPLE who actually were MOVED to make a recommendation TO HELP THEIR FRIENDS.

* ENGINEERED-TO-BE-ADDICTIVE snacks and ulta-processed quasi-edible garbage : Doritos, M&Ms, and other snack giants.

The companies selling stuff that you are stupid for consuming are not idiots ... they KNOW that those advertisements work to get idiots to buy the POISON.  


If you consume ANYTHING from a company that advertises during the Super Bowl, you really need to RETHINK your consumption habits.  

But ... just in case, you needed any clarification ... the list of Super Bowl advertisers should confirm your list of what kinds of POISONS TO AVOID AT ALL COST.

## Not JUST poisons, AVOID POISON ADDICTS!

It's not JUST that we don't watch Super Bowl advertisements ... it's not JUST that we avoid Super Bowl advertisers like the plague they are ... **WE minimize the time we spend with any POISON ADDICTS who consumes any of these kinds of POISONS** ... you cannot get ADDICTS away from defensive over-consumption of their POISONS ... you don't exactly need to shun them or give up on them, but you can cease to stop EVER giving them any affirmation their decision to poison themselves is OK with you ... STOP AFFIRMING STUPID CHOICES OF YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY! STOP IT!!! 

You don't need to be mean about not participating in someone else's self-destruction ... you can just ***politely*** tell them something like, *"Nah, thanks for the invitation and I do appreciate the invitation, but I've totally tapered off my consumption of X and if you have me there while you're swallowing X, I'll be reminding you of the fact that you're a LOSER ADDICT who is poisoning yourself and everyone around you."*
