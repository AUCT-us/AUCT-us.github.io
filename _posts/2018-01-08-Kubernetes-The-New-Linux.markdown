Given what Linux has been for the last 25 years, this would be a mighty big claim. Does it have any merit? Some pretty smart people think so ... but then again, one should ALWAYS doubt the experts. Except that these experts are not just evangelists or tech journos or pundits or people who are trying to make names for themselves on the tech conf circuit by making a splash with outlandish *visionary* claims ... they are the engineers who actually the architect and engineers leading the projects that are delivering big results, ie largely anonymous tech nobobies that we actually count on every moment of our digital lives even though we don't realize exactly what we're counting on and why.

In a recent Open Source Summit of September 2017,[Daniel Riek](https://twitter.com/llunved), Sr. Directory Systems Design & Engineering for Red Hat and leader on Red Hat's container technology strategy and [Project Atomic](https://www.projectatomic.io/), stated that containers and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) are having a deep impact on the Linux operating system (OS) that goes well beyond just DevOps and and just cloud-native applications. The concepts of application-centric packaging, process isolation through Linux containers, and immutable infrastructure are shaking up the core traditions of today's GNU/Linux operating systems. These concepts are also challenging the assumptions and approaches derived from the past 40+ years of work that originated with UNIX. The Linux distribution as we know it is coming to an end, and is being replaced by a new concept of containerized, multi-instance, multi-user applications, which can be deployed in scale-out environments.

In other words, software stacks have gotten to be too complex to be mapped onto a common monolithic namespace, so Kubernetes is effectively the new Linux ... which would mean that we should not be surprised by the enormous amount of development activity swarming around the [Kubernetes repositories](https://github.com/kubernetes).
