The rise of AI assistants [based on large language models, which can parse gargantuam amounts of bullshit text] really illustrates more than anything else how easy it is to get excited by terminology, jargon and ideas that excessively complex technobabble that sounds ridiculously sophisticated.

Cutting through the fog really depends on getting a feel for the lay of the land ... while remaining skeptical and asking harder questions in a disciplined fashion ... toward that end we have created a STARTER list of 250 questions organized into key categories that will help guide our thinking in the development of an AI-agent-enhanced Git workflows. These questions cover various aspects including technical architecture, agent design, security, scalability, and ethical considerations ... there's a lot to unpack and it can seem like the realm is expanding to become infinite, but the Reality of the thing is that the whole thing is unpackable ... it's important to understand the lay of the land, rather than to get excited about the rabbitholes.
