I have been thinking a LOT about how I should TRAIN now.  It's not really so much about me anymore, it's mostly about what I should do so that I can effectly work with others or assist others in their training?  If one survives long enough, one becomes more interested in next generation training (i.e. I want to train for the FUTURE threat, not the threat of yesterday or today). I have started looking into training systems like [Marine Corps Martial Arts close combat training](http://www.combatical.com/) or the [Israeli Krav Maga training](http://kravmaga-ikmf.com/krav-maga/train-in-israel/warriors-quest/) but I respect traditions and realize very much that I am still just an OLD MONK.

# Create a daily practice that supports and sustains you and advances your art.
1) Get up and get moving, move throughout the day. Try to eat better each day than you did the day before
2) Do the HARD THING that you fear most first so that your mind is clear to write, code, implement, debug
3) Play with principles and your original extension of principles rather than memorizing specific techniques, quotes, phrases.

# Rest and relax without engaging in bad unmindful habits
1) If you need a distraction from your pathetic life, you're doing it wrong.
2) Use or don't use sex or stimulants or drugs or asceticism, but do not allow addiction to rule you.
3) Practice the habits of mindfulness, especially in your rest and relaxation.

# The essence of being a warrior is never quitting on yourself.
1) Relapse is a necessary part of recovery, recovery is necessary to beat addiction. Don't let relapse lead you back to addiction.
2) Celebrate your victories by working on your humility; never be satisfied -- always think about the ways that you could have done something better or helped others more.
3) Be more anonymous, but rule by example. Avoid dick measuring competitions. Work harder at channeling desire for wealth, power, fame, sex, comfort into helping others.

# You can be dead serious without losing your sense of humor.
1) Practice giving humor speeches or being a standup comic.
2) Have a point, but illustrate your point with humor, koans, riddles.
3) Shut up and listen.  Work on being a better listener.
