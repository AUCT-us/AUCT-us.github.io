My Pine64 boards showed up last week ... actually before I expected to receive them ... I have come to expect people who organize and run crowdfunding campaigns for hardware underestimate how difficult it will be to meet any significant project deadline ... hardware is HARD.  Shipping hardware and dealing with all of the issues that come from customers attempting to use harder is REALLY hard ... but building an open source community around open source hardware is HARDER still ... maybe IMPOSSIBLY hard ... THAT is WHY I backed the Kickstarter project, not to build and open source community ... but maybe to watch it happen, maybe to help make it happen, MOSTLY to see how and why community building comes up short ... or what can be done differently next time ... and I am absolutely certain that there WILL BE a next time.
