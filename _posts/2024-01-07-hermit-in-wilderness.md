***What do you DO?***

*I DO hermit stuff.*  I pay my bills, pay my taxes, don't beg and do not EVER need anything. I am HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY ... because I am a hermit who chose to live in the wilderness ... except I am not really allowed to legally just go live in the physical wilderness, since the span of this physical existence happens in something called the Information Age, so I left the civilization of my peer professionals and wealthiest 1/10 of 1% to live in something of a cultural backwater or economically depressed wilderness. It's basically the same hermit gig ... I just live in a place that is as close as I am going to be allowed to living being ***away from civilization, out in the wilderness.***
