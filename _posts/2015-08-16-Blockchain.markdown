# How can we make our workflow work better?
Developing smart contracts with others depends upon a common frame of reference ... if we cannot find the right people to work with on SIMPLE contracts, there is no point in negotiating a Lose-Lose-Lose deal.  

## LEAD by developing your own technology to drive culture of freedom and responsibility
TBD

## Practice systems thinking
TBD emergent companies ... Conway's Law

## Humbly work at learning how to learn
TBD

## Be persistent, just stay at it, show up when you don't feel well
The essence of being a warrior is to never quit on yourself.

## Aim for quality not quantity, get rid of quantity
TBD

## Be more fit, seek criticism, train and exercise
TBD

## Be maniacally customer-driven, know your customer better than your customer does
TBD

## Manage your time, 5S your life ... sort, simplify, shine, standardize, sustain
TBD

## Network as if your life depends on it, becuase it does
Always work at finding new friends, but focus your time for other people appropriately ... it's a matter of time management and priorities.  An entrepreneur probably needs to focus on working twice as long as the person with a nine-to-five job -- that means 90+ hours a week, but you should allocate two and a half hours to the connections with the people in your life.  Give the VERY BEST, VERY HIGHEST QUALITY thirty minutes a day to the five most important people in your life.  Give next best thirty PERSONAL minutes to to the next twenty most important friends, family, colleagues.  Give next best thirty PERSONAL minutes to the next 100 people around you who are routinely come into contact with.  Give next best thirty PERSONAL minutes to social media, messaging the next 500 to your professional network.  If you still have energy give thirty PERSONAL minutes a day via social media or some other broadcast mechanism on the next 2500 or the members of your larger community.

## Give away everything you own, everyday ... open source burns the enemies war machine down
Don't cling to your attachments.  Don't put up with storing or maintaining or shuffling things about. Ditch your baggage so that you can be more more mobile, more flexible.
