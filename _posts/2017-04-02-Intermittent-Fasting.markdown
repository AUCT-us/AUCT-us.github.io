Getting LEAN is not easy ... it is not easy at all. It might be extremely simple and there are good mnemonics like D.O.W.N.T.I.M.E. to use to recognize waste and fat, but getting LEAN is NOT easy, because people are addicted to fat, wasteful thinking ... it doesn't matter if we are talking about Lean Enterprise, Lean Startups, Lean Production, Lean Manufacturing or just being LEAN individuals ... getting LEAN is a matter of changing habits, changing approaches to thinking ... and accomplishing that change in thinking is about institutionalizing habits and there's no substitute for perfect repetition of correct habits in order to change [subconscious, involuntary, habitual] thinking.

It is way too easy to criticize all of the different diet and weight loss programs out there ... they are ALL miserable failures.  But there is ONE success out there -- it's YOU, your body and the multiple millennia of intermittent fasting that hundreds of generations of YOUR ancestors have used in order to survive, while others didn't, to give YOU life.  In other words, the hardware in your body was effectively designed to intermittently fast in order to do several things well ... to burn off fat for energy, to think with greater clarity, to have creative insights, to have brilliant visions ... without fasting, you and your species would not have made it this far ... fasting is tough, but it is like an abrasive honing tool that sharpens the spear for physical, cognitive, spiritual optimization ... but fasting is far from popular. Fasting, particularly at first, really sucks. Fasting has enemies.  Fasting is aggressively criticized. Fasting doesn't help anyone's business model, selling fasting products will not make companies money or reward investors hoping to profit from the next Viagra.
