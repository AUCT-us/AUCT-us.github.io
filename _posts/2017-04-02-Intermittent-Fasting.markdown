Getting LEAN is not easy ... it is not easy at all. It might be extremely simple and there are good mnemonics like D.O.W.N.T.I.M.E. to use to recognize waste and fat, but getting LEAN is NOT easy, because people are addicted to fat, wasteful thinking ... it doesn't matter if we are talking about Lean Enterprise, Lean Startups, Lean Production, Lean Manufacturing or just being LEAN individuals ... getting LEAN is a matter of changing habits, changing approaches to thinking ... and accomplishing that change in thinking is about institutionalizing habits and there's no substitute for perfect repetition of correct habits in order to change [subconscious, involuntary, habitual] thinking.

It is way too easy to criticize all of the different diet and weight loss programs out there ... they are ALL miserable failures ... some do work [with sufficient commitment to drive applied diligence] for a period of six-months to a year.  When it comes to getting lean, there is ONE success out there -- it's YOU, your life, your existence and the body that has been passed to you as a result multiple millennia of intermittent fasting that hundreds of generations of YOUR ancestors.  Your ancestor used fasting in order to survive, while others didn't, to give YOU life.  Fasting, like exercise, is a GOOD stress to the body -- a stress your body NEEDS.  


Everybody can lose weight with almost any diet, if they stick with the plan to achieve caloric restriction ... the [Biggest Loser Diet](https://www.amazon.com/Biggest-Loser-Bootcamp-Get-Real-Get-Results/dp/084874554X) is the quintessential example, i.e. the diet works and achieves impressive results for 6 months, but THEN the weight is regained.  The problem with almost all diets is the [basal metabolic rate decrease](https://youtu.be/v9Aw0P7GjHE?t=43m16s) that happens with mere caloric restriction -- this means that after six months or so, the weight losses from caloric restriction get a LOT tougher because the basal metabolic rate has been decreases. In other words, fasting is NOT about caloric restriction -- it is about changing hormones, fasting is about changing the epigentics of the gut bacteria ... but also fasting is about getting rid of bad habits, snacking, eating in the car, eating while doing something else and [eliminating all forms of mindless eating](https://youtu.be/v9Aw0P7GjHE?t=50m19s).

In other words, the hardware in your body was effectively designed to intermittently fast ... it's only RECENTLY that we have undermined our bodies by allowing ourselves to become habitually addicted to bad habits, engaged in mindless eating, eating while driving, eating at our desks, eating while watching television or surfing the net.  

Fasting is painful, it's unrelenting pain and therefore fasting is STRESSFUl ... fasting is like an exercise program that pushes you beyond the point that you thought you signed up for. Nobody should underestimate how difficult fasting is -- people do need to understand that, as with exercise and exercise past the point of comfort, there will be benefits ... but that doesn't mean the benefits will immediately be massive; the results will be HUMBLING.  Think of the results as you would body building. Nobody is going to win a Mr. Universe contest after five or six workouts or two weeks of extreme, grueling workouts in the gym ... most body builders quit because the results are humbling and they think that "the view is not worth the climb". Fasting will burn off fat for energy, it will allow you to think with greater clarity, it will allow you to have more creative insights, it will allow you to have brilliant spiritual visions ... but FIRST fasting will be stressful and painful and intolerable.  You will NEVER get addicted to fasting.  

Fasting is a habit that is far too easy to walk away from ... affluent humans do not fast because fasting is not fun ... for affluent human beings, fasting is MINDFUL DISCIPLINE.  However, without fasting, you and your species would not have made it this far ... fasting is tough, but it is like an abrasive honing tool that sharpens the spear for physical, cognitive, spiritual optimization ... but fasting is far from popular. Fasting, particularly at first, really sucks. Fasting has enemies. Fasting is aggressively criticized. Fasting doesn't help anyone's business model, selling fasting products will not make companies money or reward investors hoping to profit from the next Viagra.
