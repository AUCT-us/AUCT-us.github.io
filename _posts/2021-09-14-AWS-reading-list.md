***The entire AWS offering is more than daunting enough to scare most people off...***that's a bit of an understatement, especially because of the security, authentication and billing matters, ie if you screw something up -- you will PAY. It seems rather clear that AWS wants its billing and cost management to be impossible to figure out.

It is probably best to START with IAM and organization structure ... that is a a pre-cursor to understanding billing and cost management, even you are using the free tier.
