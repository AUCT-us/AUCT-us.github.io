This is an explanation of why I think we should just let things rot ... although there are giant benefits to subtly manipulating, ie ACCELERATING, the rotting process.

The complexity of soil ecosystems has some important lessons for how we think about human interactions and optimizing those interactions.

Unfortunately, human beings really know remarkably little about soil ecosystems ... there are people who know a lot ... but generally speaking, the population of farmers in the world knows a LOT more about government programs than they know about soil fungi, bacteria, earthworms and plant roots interactions ... because IT PAYS to study farm programs -- there's not really any serious money in building soil ... so when MOST farmers are bouncing around in their tractor seats, a lot of them might be worried about farm programs, revenue assurance policies, making sure that they've dotted the i's and crossed the t's so that they are still eligible for maximized federally-subsidized guaranteed income streams to finance the purchase of more equipment or farmland ... but MOST of them are NOT thinking about optimizing the soil ecosystems under their control -- some are, but MOST are thinking more about farm programs because farm programs drive incentives and influence the mindshare of what sharp, capable, hard-working people think about.

So if you are one of those who still imagines that government is NOT the problem ... please correct your thinking ... when it comes to agriculture, food and soil science, government is most definitely THE PROBLEM ... or, more correctly, it creates and feeds the problem of ultra-risk averse welfare maximization [rather than scarce amounts of ambition, creativity and investment devoted to new product creation and value addition in the economy] coupled with political rent-seeking by industry organizations paid for by dues / checkoffs / contributions from welfare recipients that defend and expand welfare payments and subsidies to people who are already quite wealthy.  

There's a 3000-yr-old chinese proverb that applies to the the debacle created by the USDA and various farm programs ... as well as the Affordable Care Act, or Dodd-Frank or any other monsterous debacle created by clueless morons trying to give the appearance that they want to help ... **A government has a strategy. The people have counter strategies.**   

Mostly, we should think about [what really matters](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLElrASo3VHBxt9zg3oRoKSqmyiCHct4Ai).  The purpose of everything we do ... programming, writing, experimenting, trying things ... is INSIGHT. It's not getting a candidate elected OR convincing someone to believe a LIE OR jealously manipulating and obfuscating truth so that our dick looks bigger in the giant dick-measuring contest that we think everyone wants to be part of. The indisputable truth is still there ...  **Every politician, every government has a [WORTHLESS] strategy. The people have counter strategies for finding insight in making their lives better.**  The world doesn't really need calories or protein or energy -- people can figure that stuff out ... we should think a lot more about [what really matters](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLElrASo3VHBxt9zg3oRoKSqmyiCHct4Ai) in terms of helping people to find INSIGHT.

*Insight is always in short supply.* 

If you look at [what is happening down at the suburban street level in the world of permaculture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1BpauXRp6U), you have to be excited about the 'counter strategies' that PEOPLE are developing ... without or in spite of government interference.  The largest danger that these independent efforts faces is the subtle subversion executed by government officials ... an example of the Tao of Cocksuckers ... as the officials attempt to co-opt and direct the movement by offering policies, programs and incentives to ~participate~ in their government-controlled prison.  The Tao of Cocksuckers involves subtly inducing independent people to follow the MASTER, accept assistance from the MASTER and get comfortable with the MASTER ... while the MASTER places the radio-controlled shock collar and tracking device around your neck, and maybe embeds a carefully selected mix of stories in your Facebook feed so that even the thoughts that are imagined to be spontaneous are actually the result of subconscious programming.

The cocksuckers are incredibly powerful ... so powerful that there is cold civil war that is now underway in which the cocksuckers are persecuting, taxing and regulating the inventors, creators, entrepreneurs and other productive people into oblivion ... this COLD civil war will eventually become a HOT civil war ... maybe not immediately, in the next year or decade, but eventually it will happen.

People who imagine that overthrow of the government is impossible because the government holds all the resources do not understand the nature of fighting and using a stronger, but unjust opponent's strengths and weapons against him. The bureaucratic centralizers of the Union are still in the process of devising and improving upon the methods that will give them a demoralizing defeat and complete, incomprehensible capitulation.

Don't rush them ... if they need another century, fine ... give them time, whether it was McClelland fighting Lee in the 19th century or folks like McNamara and Westmoreland fighting Gi√°p in the 20th, the game still works the same ... ultimately, any insurgency with a just cause ... even if it's like Lee/Jackson v McClelland with a perceived just cause of the Union being in Virginia ... the supposedly weaker opponent ALWAYS annihilates an enemy with more and better systems, resources, arms, personnel ... if Lee hadn't gone into Pennsylvania in 1863, the South could have lasted a very long time, someone would have stepped up to take Jackson's place. The South was ultimately going to lose because its cause, ie perpetuation of slavery, was thoroughly and deeply unjust ... the Union would have found ways to incompetently continue to provide the CSA with "free" resources and materials; the Union did not win as much as South LOST the First Civil War because its unjust cause eventually dried up its talent and any hope of foreign assistance.

It's not really different now ... it is only a matter of time before the power centralizers LOSE to those wishing for distributed and decentralized freedom and lose ... the authoritarians will lose in a completely convincing and obvious fashion ... the just cause can always tolerate incredibly high casualties because anything perceived as a just and righteous cause is ALWAYS going to be an unstoppable recruiting tool to bring in new allies. Consider the case of Al Qaeda and ISIS ... the PERCEPTION of their cause being just [in certain populations] means that defeating them will be next to impossible, regardless of the resources deployed ... the ONLY way to defeat them is by correcting the perception that their cause is just. Frankly, it will be IMPOSSIBLE to do that as long as we don't do a better job of providing a better alternative, with an economy and culture that encourages a higher rate of new business formation and ventures that create new opportunities for billions of young people wanting to do something meaningful with their lives.

As long as the top-down centralizers and powerful cronies are in control and stifling bottom-up entrepreneurial freedom, the West's cause will be equally as unjust as Al Qaeda's or ISIS's ... it will only be a different flavor of injustice.
