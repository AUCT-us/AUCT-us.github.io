This is an explanation of why I think we should just let things rot ... although there are giant benefits to subtly manipulating the rotting process.

The complexity of soil ecosystems has some important lessons for how we think about human interactions and optimizing those interactions.

Unfortunately, human beings really know remarkably little about soil ecosystems ... there are people who know a lot ... but generally speaking, the population of farmers in the world knows a LOT more about government programs than they know about soil fungi, bacteria, earthworms and plant roots interactions ... because IT PAYS to study farm programs -- there's not really any serious money in building soil ... so when MOST farmers are bouncing around in their tractor seats, a lot of them might be worried about farm programs, revenue assurance policies, making sure that they've dotted the i's and crossed the t's so that they are still eligible for maximized federally-subsidized guaranteed income streams to finance the purchase of more equipment or farmland ... but MOST of them are NOT thinking about optimizing the soil ecosystems under their control -- some are, but MOST are thinking more about farm programs because farm programs drive incentives and influence the mindshare of what sharp, capable, hard-working people think about.

So if you are one of those who still imagines that government is NOT the problem ... please correct your thinking ... when it comes to agriculture, food and soil science, government is most definitely THE PROBLEM. 

There's a 3000-yr-old chinese proverb that applies to the the debacle created by the USDA and various farm program ... A government has a strategy. The people have counter strategies.   If you look at [what is happening down at the suburban street level in the world of permaculture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1BpauXRp6U), you have to be excited about the 'counter strategies' that PEOPLE are developing.
