Distributed security is one of my [philanthropic venture](http://markbruns.github.io/philanthropy/mvp/opensource/2017/07/15/Venture-Philanthropy.html) areas ... it involves a number of very, very basic things which people might not even regard as security issues, because they take them for granted ... things like providing food, water, shelter, utilities and very basic and fundamental needs ... communication phyical layers, software-defined radio, computing architecture and infrastructure, information security.  It also includes things like health, basic medical care, fitness, self-defense and very basic self-defense weapons manufacture. My thoughts on the distribution of security is inspired by Robert Heinlein who is rather famous for his views about how and why a human being should be able to some very fundamental and basic things.
