Freedom is not free ... we can kind of coast on the freedom provided for us, but we need to exercise those freedoms, especially the freedom to inform ourselves. We live in an information age and are subject to what could be described as information war. Of course, there is no substitute for being fiercely skeptical and yet generally aware enough of technological developments in warfighting and reasonably familar with how those technologies might be obtained implemented so that one can defend oneself. It is necessary for a well-informed citizenry to be able to defend against tyranny ... even if that defense would involve certain death for most of those doing the fighting. It's your duty as a citizen to kinda know what's going on and not be completely helpless in the face of those who would gladly prefer to keep you stupid or using their preferred media choices to program you to accept their form of tyranny.

You are kidding yourself if you think that you can be free if you don't devote at least some mental energy to the topic of self-defense and awareness of different mechanisms of self-defense. In keeping with the distributed defense philosophical underpinnings of the 2nd Amendment of the US Constitutions, it is quite necessary for citizens to be able to procure, keep and bear arms ... and arms is certainly not limited to firearms ... it is about a robust defense and awareness of what that defense would require ... therefore it is necessary to explore the implications of new technologies and the potential impact of those technologies on the future of warfighting and self-defense in the event of civil wars and insurrections. 

In the ongoing war against tyranny ...the best way to PREVENT the war from taking your ability to fight away is to use what freedom you have to prepare for what is likely to be an inevitable reality ... prevention is the only thing that really makes tyranny less likely. 

The reality that freedom can never be free, but must be continually exercised is why we continue to delve into the topics like RTOS and fault-tolerant distributed data databases, communications technologies for self-organizing hierarchies of smart systems ... in order to lay the groundwork for our future understanding of things that we expect to be more important [with applicability in many different fields] such as [swarm robotics](https://web.archive.org/web/20180726044234/https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-62533-1_15.pdf).  A topic like swarm robotics matters because swarm robotics is a logistic technology, for moving material and machines ... and, in use as as a defense technlogy, swarm robotics is all about the disruption of logistics ... for example, in the Ukrainian strikes against Russian ammo depots, we see ways in how swarms of hundreds of robotic UAVs and or tens of sea drones act as decoys, while armed drones precisely deliver payloads that destroy or at least temporarily disrupt the invading tyrant's warfighting capability.

We can start thinking about self-organizing, but independent autonomous robots by reviewing materials on [Self-organizing Nervous Systems (SoNS) of n-multiple independent robots for coordinated swarm robotics](https://browse.arxiv.org/abs/2401.13103). {*NOTE: Please be advised that the [full pdf for this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13103.pdf) is quite large and will take longer than most*}.  If you are interested in this material and the level of development in this field, it also a good idea, in order to have some understanding of the PUBLICLY AVAILABLE pre-print knowledge, to keep up [daily] with new developments in [Arxiv's most recent Computer Science:Robotics preprints](https://browse.arxiv.org/list/cs.RO/recent). 

***Obviously, we should not expect ALL of the current knowledge to immediately show up on Arxiv! It's just that Arxiv does us as provide ordinary members of the public around the world with a LAGGING indication of the level of development in knowledge that is happening in this particular discipline of tech development.***  

The point of this is that warfighting systems dependent upon tanks, motorized artillery and different automotive warfighting systems which were useful a decade ago have become rapidly become increasingly obsolete as new tech-enabled warfighting strategies have been proven effective ... especially, based on what the world has seen in the last couple years.  The warfighting methods of 2014 are now BADLY DATED ... because things like the technological developments such as Self-Organizing Nervous Systems (SoNS) we see in swarm robotics nowadays have made multi-hundred or multi-thousand drone [self-organizing] coordinated swarm technology a battlefield reality.  **Weapon systems that worked in Afghanistan or Iraq wars of the 2000s and 2010s are now obsolete; weapons systems that were used in the 1990s are not DANGEROUSLY obsolete.  IT IS TIME TO DISPOSE OF THE INVENTORIES OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES WHILE THEY STILL ARE VALUED.**
