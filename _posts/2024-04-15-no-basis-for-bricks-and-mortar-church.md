# Physical Church

The Bible NEVER ONCE refers the church as a physical building, but as a community of believers. Remember ... NOT ONCE!

Ephesians 2:19-22 uses the analogy of a building to describe the church, but it’s not referring to a physical structure of bricks and mortar. Instead, it speaks of Jesus’ presence in the church. PEOPLE are the building blocks of the church ... and we see the SAME model over and over and over again in the New Testament ... two or more people gathering together in Jesus’ name ... sharing the Gospel ... and the Holy Spirit is there with them.

# Pulpit

The use of a pulpit is neither commanded nor prohibited in the Bible ... it's just NOT mentioned ... AT ALL. The Sermon on the Mount was delivered by Jesus on a hillside, NOT FROM A PULPIT. John the Baptist preached the message of the coming Messiah in the wilderness ... NOT FROM A PULPIT.  The Apostle Paul preached from a window sill; the apostle's shared their message in jail cell ... NOT FROM PULPITS.

Pulpits are just NOT mentioned.

The pulpit is often associated with MODERN preaching in physical churches that we grew up with OR especially with televangelists on the teevee ... so this key aspect of worship has a much scriptural basis as doing your taxes with tax software OR mowing your lawn with zero-turning-radius mower OR with driving to a large box store and grabbing a shopping cart to go through the superstore so that you can get your daily bread. 

The Apostle Paul instructed the Colossians to let the word of Christ dwell in them richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to God. However, it’s important to note that the PHYSICAL BUILDING ... with a pulpit for preachy types to use to command respect from an audience ... is a completely MODERN, totally artificial, manmade addition to Christian CORPORATE HUMAN-INSTITUTIONALIZED formal worship ... there is ZERO scriptural requirement for a pulpit or physcial sanctuary built like an auditorium so that all of the crowds attention can be focused on one narcissist ... there's NO REASON TO FEED NARCISSISTIC PREACHINESS whatsoever.

Jesus commanded attention because he spoke with authority ... "And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes." - [Matthew 7:28-29](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+7:28-29)

# Choir / Musical Infrastructure Investment

There are several references to music and singing in the Bible, ie usually a spontaneous exhibition of JOY and unbounded LOVE of the Lord ... as with Paul and Silas praying and singing praises in their jail cell, [Acts 16:25-34](https://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/passage/?q=acts+16:25-34) ... these spontaneous exhibitions of JOY and LOVE are somehow twisted into something like a scriptural basis for a formal, funded, institutionalized, CAREFULLY-ORGANIZED choir. Obviously, there is nothing particularly WRONG with a practiced, rehearsed, organized, institutional musical ministry ... BUT there is no more basis for a REQUIRED musical ministry in scripture than there is for a REQUIRED, WELL-FUNDED, PARTICIPATION-REQUIRED prison or jail ministry. 

Moreover, the specific organization and function of choirs can vary widely among different Christian traditions, but a pattern always emerges.  The best choir is arguably the Mormon Tabernacle Choir; the southern gospel choirs are probably a close second; these INSTITUTIONS are a matter of organization PRIDE and funding is demanded of the congregations to support these things, ie even in POOR churches, the collection plate is passed to fund the organ or piano "so that our kids can have a choir they can take pride in." We all know that there is definitely a strong degree of music envy or competitive pride in church choirs, but the Bible is could not be more clear on whether pride or envy are good things.
