## Focus on Making Corrections A Christian Ministry to ALL of The People Involved

Not just the incarcerated ... probably not even primarily the incarcerated ... but mainly, first and foremost, the victims

Include the Sheriff and Deputies, Mental Health Staff, County Board of Supervisors [as representatives of the taxpayers]

Focus on the SOULS of the people involved ... rather than the physical, mental, emotional, material realities of the people involved ... the people in jail are there for a reason, but they are also there as a reminder to everyone involved that we are no different ... we are ALL in need of spiritual redemption.

We are ALL in need of help in rebuilding our courage and mindfulness ... that is impossible, unless we accept the significance of Christ's Sacrifice and Resurrection.

## On the mental, emotional, psychological side

# Christian Jail Ministry MUST BE rooted in the Resurrection

The Resurrection of Christ cannot be stressed enough for Christians, ESPECIALLY for those involved in a jail ministry.

For those involved, we must FIRST understand that the Christ's Resurrection is the FOUNDATION of OUR faith ... OUR faith is one of SPIRITUAL transformation ... OUR faith must be SPIRITUAL ... we cannot be involved a spiritual ministry for anything but SPIRITUAL reasons, helping to rescue SOULS ... it's up to the incarcerated to pay their debts and heal themselves mentally, emotionally, psychologically -- our ministry is about SOULS, not *getting out of jail free*... it simply cannot be a material mental faith, although there will likely be material or mental manifestations ... our faith must be SPIRITUAL. 

Christ did not die on the cross, so that we could have a post-death retirement plan with full accommodations for all of the people we love and care about in a post-death retirement community. 

Christ died on the cross to REDEEM OUR SOULS.

Christ died on the cross, descended into Hell and the paid the price for us ... to REDEEM OUR SOULS ... so that we could have a SPIRITUAL life ... and THAT is beyond what we can really comprehend ... especially, as long as our comprehension is limited by our clinging to the outward material manifestations of this existence.  

It should be obvious to us that the life that we have in our human existence is still very much going to HAVE TO be a life that is bound by the material, mental or emotional limitations of our human existence ... **accepting Christ as the savior of your SOUL is not an expedient get-out-of-jail-free card.**

## Christ died on the cross to REDEEM OUR SOULS

So that the Holy Spirit can come into our lives and completely transform our spiritual being.

When that happens, since we will be able to experience a spiritual life that is no longer bound by the material, mental or emotional limitations of our human existence ... that means that we will finally be free to mindfully focus on our shortcomings and to begin to make amends.

But SPIRITUAL REDEMPTION is not about getting out of jail, it's not about having our debts paid off, it's not about being free from medical/health issues, it's not about being free from our relationships and other commitments we have made ... it means that since we have accepted Christ as our SPIRITUAL savior, the Holy Spirit can come into our lives and begin to furnish us with the courage and mindfulness and PEACE that we will need to address the physical, mental, emotional, material realities of our human existence.

It's STILL going to be up to us to work at DILIGENTLY DEVELOPING our courage and mindfulness ... but participation in the JAIL MINISTRY ... for EVERYONE ... is about ALL of us admitting that we have ALL fallen short of the glory of God ... and that we are ALL in need of spiritual redemption ... and that we are ALL in need of help in rebuilding our courage and mindfulness ... and the JAIL MINISTRY is about SHOWING UP to be a PRESENCE that gives witness of how the Holy Spirit has provided us with the insight and ambition to address the difficulties of rebuilding our courage and mindfulness ... but MOSTLY the JAIL MINISTRY is about showing up to share the complete JOY that is possible only from SPIRITUAL REBIRTH ... something that is impossible, unless we accept the significance of Christ's Sacrifice and Resurrection.

For us involved in jail ministry, Christ's LOVE for us is BROTHERLY LOVE ... brotherly love means ass-chewings, liberal ridicule of falling back into idiot habits -- but it also means giving a shit, actually caring enough to show up, even if FROWNS are the only thing that happens we show up.  Brotherly love is not a new parent's ecstatic huggie-kissie baby-talk love that admires even the color and fragrance of poop in the diaper [as long as the kid is healthy]; it's not even the mother's kind of love that gives kids allowances just for being kids [without having to earn every nickel doing nasty chores] ... it's not a grandmother's love that gives the grandkids snacks and buys them tickets to amusement parks and lets the grandkids get away with things that her kids never would have gotten away with. For us involved in jail ministry, Christ's LOVE for us is BROTHERLY LOVE.

*For Christians, there can be no other day in the year that is more genuinely worthy of a SPECIAL day of celebration than Easter.*

## The Resurrection is the FOUNDATION of our Christian faith

Christ's death and the Resurrection are what Christianity is about ... without the Resurrection, we're JUST sort of regurgitating favorite quotes, talking about pleasant platitudes, egotistically displaying how we have been good little boys who memorized our favorite verses of scripture ... without the Resurrection, the Christian faith is EMPTY ... without the Resurrection, the Christian faith would not really be any different than regurgitateing aphorisms and favorite passages from the Classics.

Without continually bringing our FOCUS back to the Resurrection and what it means, the rest of Christian yakking about one thing or another, is just [mere storytelling, like a soothing classic story on radio in wartime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElNB3tldviA) ... even though, some Christians might get defensive about this characterization, Christianity's more than a classic story. 

**The Resurrection is not kidstuff.** AT ALL. And our faith is not just about things like comfortable, warm fuzzy memories of nice Christian grandmothers telling The Story to us in Sunday School, developing the setting, plot, characters, theme, conflict and point of view in our favorite story as we color in the drawings of the Sunday School handouts.

In [1 Corinthians 15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015&version=NIV) the Apostle Paul explains the importance of the resurrection to the Christian faith: "And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith."

*The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body,*.

To KNOW God is to have directly experienced something like a vision or an epiphany of the independence of spiritual life ... that sort of life-changing vision or epiphany is possible ONLY through the Resurrection ... and through the Holy Spirit coming into our lives and completely transforming our spiritual being.

A spiritual life is NOT a physical, mental, emotional reboot ... in computer parlance, it's not just a new operating system, or new hardware -- a spiritual rebirth means CHANGE and living your life as if your ETERNAL SOUL mattered.

The Resurrection of Jesus Christ is not just the most important thing to the Christan faith ... of course, the Resurrection has driven has EVERYTHING about the Christian REVOLUTION that began two millenia ago ... but the sigificance of the Resurrection is BIGGER than the sum total of EVERYTHING that humans have accomplished in the entirety of the species existence ... it's not about our past ... all of our past accomplishments, piles of possession, relationships and all of the errors we commit in this existence do not matter ... the Resurrection MATTERS, because of what is to come, throughout all eternity ... Christ died for your sins and rose again because your eternal soul [now redeemed and free, if you accept salvation] WILL matter that much through GRACE ... we don't need to worry about exactly what the after life might look like; we can be assured that whatever comes next will be better than anything that any human can imagine. The Resurrection of Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of our Christian faith.

## Accepting the Christ's Sacrifice and Resurrection BEGINS to Open Our Soul to Being Refilled By The Holy Spirit
