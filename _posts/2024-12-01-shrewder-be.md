# Embrace freer, fairer, more open markets ... IMPROVE prediction markets in order to make everyone shrewder, better able to assess motives of others while they assess outcomes"

What if prediction markets were themselves based upon a collaborative, open source development community of auctioneers and political economists skilled enough in software development and secure dev ops administration to not only use, but OWN and extend their own prediction market platform.

The 2024 election is just over in the United States and there are lessons that we can learn. *One thing that we can learn, by reflecting on the elections, the sorry state of polling and how PolyMarket got the result right is that we probably should care much more about improving prediction markets!*

ANY kind of market can really never be free enough, fair enough or open enough ... but the best way to improve markets is to engage tech-savvy auctioneers who love the freedom of auction and free markets enough to work at making the participants more shrewd, practiced, experienced and aware of the hidden informatational cues that price movements deliver.
