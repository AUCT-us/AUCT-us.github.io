*My ONLY purpose in life is to understand and celebrate my Creator's will.*

It's worth repeating, over and OVER ... with extra EMPHASIS ... *because I really do mean this, even though my [bad] habits might indicate otherwise*.

**My ONLY purpose in life is to understand and celebrate my Creator's will.**

The degree to which I should care about anything else is a derivative of my desire to know and understand my Creator's will. I do get distracted by other things, but those other distractions cause me to become MISERABLE.

I am far from perfect in this, but I do KNOW with 100% certainty that **my ONLY purpose in life is to understand and celebrate my Creator's will** ... this means that, after prayer, the most important thing that I must do is to *WORK* concretely on some aspect of breaking the bad habits of being myself ... sometimes, I think that I am gaining, but then I realize how much farther I have left to go.

I certainly do not understand my Creator's will completely, so I MUST pay more attention to understanding my Creator's will than anything else in the world. In a practical manner, this sole driving purpose must drive the prioritization of my time and that means that I must focus on my constant prayer that my Creator's will be done. 

# The Creator's will is ultimately drives the Universe toward a point of PERFECTION.

The human species is a TINY INSIGNIFICANT PART of the Universe ... the only thing that is truly amazing about humans is the incredibly high opinion that humans have of their species or of humanity. The human species and EVERY last thing that the human species sets in motion will always be a TINY INSIGNIFICANT PART of the Universe ... and the significance of this portion of the Universe is inversely proportional to the species' opinion of its significance, ie the more hubristic the opinion that humans have, the more likely they are to sow the seeds of their demise.  

It is up to me to adapt to the opportunities that my Creator's will affords me each day. For example, it is neither my Creator's will that I have children nor is it my Creator's will that I do not have children -- I am ***MUCH HAPPIER** without children because I feel like I have been given the gift of complete freedom to pursue things like open source tool building for scientific computing; I am free from having to entertain others and try to help them solve their problems ... but I would adapt if I were forced to become a parent and take care of children. So, I do know that I am much, much, MUCH happier WITHOUT having to worry about children or any kind of partner or spousal relationship. 

There are those who tell me that the world would end if everyone thought like me ... which is demonstrably laughable on several different levels ... first of all, there are well over 8 billion of my species on this planet and it is quite apparent that there's ZERO risk whatsoever that the human population will seriously decline below the point where it has totally subdued all other lifeforms on planet ... secondly, my Creator might not send another flood to erase a species that he has second thoughts about, but it's probably safe to say that is something else cataclysmic in store, not necessarily next year or in the next 1000 years -- but EVENTUALLY. If that happens, the planet and the rest of creation will be better off without human beings ... bringing on the cataclysm OR diverting it from happening is not my call; I am not going to waste any time worrying about what impacts that catalclysm will have on the descendants of humans in existence. What I am sure of is that **the Creator's will is ultimately drives the Universe toward a point of PERFECTION.**
