It's valentine's day and BETTER YET, it's Lent

So since Valentine's Day fell on LENT this year ... how about if we try to  FALL IN LOVE with the perfect selves that we could be, if we would only get seriously about working on ourselves to be a more perfect Christ-like example of the human God created us to be. It will involve a lot of SACRIFICES and giving up things [at least temporarily] but that's what Lent is all about.

An DON'T STRESS if you missed opening gunshot signifying the first day of Lent ... you can still get in on Lent ... you could do a good forty day of Lent any time you felt the urge to fast or REALLY BUCKLE DOWN hard on something for a forty day push.  

Celebrations of rituals is similar to the celebrations of holidays on a particular day or according to a particular schedule.

You can celebrate the fundamental principles behind ANY of these danged human holidays or human rituals ANY TIME you want to … it is far more important that you spend the time seriously contemplating THE POINT of the ritual or holiday rather than worrying about when the crowd of gossips, busybodies and the whole peer-pressure lynchmob of conformists is doing to drag the unholy into their ritualistic conformance.

There’s no reason to go out and be deliberately antagonistic, but we can let the lost souls and dead bury their dead … the POINT of the holidays or rituals is fine … Lent’s a perfect example — the whole POINT of Lent is to tell Satan [and affluent excesses and addictions to human-based comfort] to go f*** himself … to quietly be able to just go without [for an extended period of time] to re-prove to one’s self that one can actually leave the booze or any kind of addictive comfort or pleasure alone for forty days … and instead do a deep dive on how much one’s affluent lifestyle is diverting one’s focus away from the passion of the Christ, how much God loves His creation and what God gave up in sending His only Son into hell to double down on the love that drives the beauty of that entire Creation.

When anyone feels called to celebrate the meaning of Lent, the forty days that are coming up are never a bad time … as people who try to live according to Heidelberg catechism, we might sometimes need reminders of [what our only true comfort in this life and whatever comes after has to be](https://www.heidelberg-catechism.com/en/lords-days/1.html).

# This Lent ... starting with right now, whenever now is ...

We will BUILD our spiritual and mental efforts on top of the primarily PHYSICAL infrastructure we will be trying to build with our [Strength, Conditioning, Mobility self-coaching syllabus](https://markbruns.github.io/template/2024/01/14/strength-conditioning-mobility-coaching.html) ... is always going to be a DEVELOPMENTAL work in progress we are attempting to implement disciplined INTENSITY of self-coaching and the CONSISTENCY always doing as many good, non-junk reps as we can do.

Better health needs to be the physical foundation of our OVERALL self-improvement program ... but the point of our self-improvement program is spiritual self-improvement ... supported by mental self-improvement ... resting a top a physical foundation.  

We are certainly not going to compete in any sport ... in fact, at this point in our lives, we can definitely see the days coming when our physical well-being will no longer be assured ... we also can see, by looking those around us, like the POTUS for example, that our mental well-being will also longer be assured.  If we want to be better SPIRITUAL students or SPIRITUAL disciples, we should first provide the foundation of being more healthy and more fit so that we are even able to show up as willing students or disciples without getting to that point where we are praying for the end to come.

## We are BLESSED to live in a world that helps us to be better and better disciples

We should be ASHAMED of ourselves for being ungrateful ... or neglecting the opportunities this existence provides us, especially since life keeps getting better and better for us.  We should be ASHAMED of ourselves for not being more grateful for the opportunities we have to be better and better disciples.

Since I like the way that AI prompt me to ask way more questions, I started by asking CoPilot and Gemini to [curate a syllabus for a deep dive study of Lent including the most impactful spiritual, mental, and physical considerations for someone who is going to be especially serious for forty days about developing a plan for becoming like Christ or a more perfect modern-day example of the humans God created?](https://g.co/gemini/share/3ae1d74180ac).

The following outline was developed by CoPilot, Gemini ... with my own input and editing [which might make it worse, or too biased] but you can just click on the link ABOVE ... or copy the question into your favorite AI and see if you like that better.  It's not going to radically different than what you should expect, but an AI is good for mapping out a basic outline which you can modify, expand or re-prioritize to suit your own needs and circumstances.

## Week 1: Understanding Lent
- Introduction to Lent
- The Biblical basis for Lent
- The significance of the 40 days

## Week 2: Spiritual Considerations
- The role of prayer during Lent
- Fasting and its spiritual significance
- Almsgiving and service
## Week 3: Mental Considerations
- Developing positive habits
- Cultivating gratitude, joy, and openness
- Overcoming challenges and temptations
## Week 4: Physical Considerations
- The physical benefits of fasting
- Balancing physical and spiritual health
- Understanding the connection between physical actions and spiritual growth
## Week 5: Becoming Like Christ
- Understanding the call to Christlikeness
- Emulating Christ's attributes
- The role of the Holy Spirit in transformation
## Week 6: Modern-Day Examples
- Learning from modern-day examples of Christ-like living
- Applying lessons from these examples to your own life
## Week 7: Reflection and Preparation for Easter
- Reflecting on the journey of Lent
- Preparing your heart for the celebration of Easter

Now REMEMBER the GOAL of this is to deepen our understanding of Lent and use this forty period for FOCUSING on spiritual growth and transformation. What we have is only a starting outline [which will be a work-in-progress thoughout Lent].  We will modify this outline to suit our personal needs and circumstances ... and NEXT YEAR we might have a better outline for doing this again ***as an old AI tradition*** that we can always look forward to observing every year at Lent.
