Never mind the stupid cliches!  

    * *Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new exercise program.*
    * *Start with low-intensity exercises and gradually increase intensity and duration.*
    * *Tailor the syllabus based on the individualâ€™s preferences, health conditions, and fitness level.*

***Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've heard that shit a million times -- good advice, we all get it.***  I am not one bit interested in making a college football team, but I do look at the results of these top flight college sports programs and the degree to which they NEED really great strength and conditioning coaches ... whereas they can use almost anybody, even somebody's son, to be a coach or offensive coordinator ... they head coaches DO NOT FUCK AROUND when it comes to choosing and compensating a strength and conditioning coach.  

Accordingly, I decided to ask CoPilot to [develop a strength and conditioning syllabus](https://sl.bing.net/dK3ib8cQvHE) to help me get started thinking about the discipline of developing better discipline by putting together a strength and conditioning program that *actually makes sense* FOR ME, ie **something that I will actually do** -- *not just some asinine exercise or calisthenic that some fitness app tells me I should do.

Of course, consistency and gradual progress are key ... if I don't NEED to make a few steps on the journey every day, I'm not just going to magically enjoy the stupid journey ... I don't need to stay motivated; motivation can't be on me -- it HAS TO BE something, like landscape architecture and gardening that I need to do every day ... the key to prioritizing safety throughout the process is all about the whole program being a series sort of small meaningful chores that need to get done every day -- that's why the whole strength and conditioning program has to involve gardening and landscaping ... because I don't give a fuck about getting in shape to make the football team.

The KEY really boils down to me having chores that I have to do every day ... I can turn off and ignore a stupid fitness app -- the real needs all about an IMMEDIATE WHY, something I HAVE TO DO, not a pop-up reminder from an app, but something REAL that needs attention, like a garden or an edible foodscaping project.  It has to be REAL ... something where I can see what I have done even it's just something like re-positioning the geraniums to give the ones that aren't blooming more sun and move the blooming ones into the shadier areas so their blooms last longer ... there has to be a PHYSICAL, immediate WHY implicit in a daily set of chores that reminds one why he even needs to even bother with strength and conditioning. It does not work to have a distant, off-in-the-future WHY, eg I don't want to die unfit -- **the distant, nebulous, off-in-the-future "it's good for you" WHY is just not close to being good enough for an old guy.**
