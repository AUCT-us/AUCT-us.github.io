***Never mind the stupid cliches!*** Strength and conditioning is going to be heavy on cliches ... in some ways, because it's always going to be the three-legged stool of Development, Intensity and Consistency ... and no, you can't just skip to the cliche answer that it's all about CONSISTENCY ... of course, it is BUT ... STOP BEING A CONSISTENT IDIOT!

You have have the RIGHT consistency. 

Your stupid old way of doing things DID NOT WORK, because you CONSISTENTLY short-cutted your thinking on just not bothering with the details being CONSISTENTLY WRONG in CONSISTENTLY getting the MINIMAL AMOUNT done ... so that you could CONSISTENTLY go right back to your old habits, maybe not right away but within a couple week or a month you FORGOT all about that undeveloped, mediocre, not thought through intensity ... like you CONSISTENTLY do every time you start and exercise program. 

You have to be consistent with STUDIED, COACHED, CRITIQUED, IMPROVED ***intensity*** ... in order to ensure that you are actually mindfully aware, disciplined and critically encouraging with every INTENSE repitition of all of those *consistenty* done repetitions that you are going to do ... HOW are you going to coach yourself on your reps; WHERE is the INSTENSITY going to come from?

Of course, being CONSISTENTLY INTENSE is not going to help you achieve your MAJOR goal of BETTER HEALTH with all of its supporting SMART objectives if you are optimizing the wrong things or strategically calling the wrong plays.  You have to DEVELOP a balanced overall plan that you will INTENSELY improve with discipline intent CONSISTENTLY ... so that why we START with the DEVELOPMENT of a syllabus -- we might copy a lot of material and use a lot of cliches, but the DEVELOPMENT of our own syllabus has to be specifically DEVELOPED for us.

# Development

You will always hear the following bullet points below ... because the advice is ALWAYS true, ALWAYS important ... *Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've heard that shit a million times -- good advice, we all get it.*  ***No you REALLY don't GET it ... AT ALL!***

That's why you have to endure hearing it repeated over and over again, because people  always disregard it ... so YOU have to REPEAT these cliche bullet points over and over again to yourself and THINK about why they matter to you.:

    * *Always consult with a **HEALTH**care provider before starting any new exercise program.*
    * *Start with low-intensity exercises and gradually increase intensity and duration.*
    * *Tailor the syllabus based on the individualâ€™s preferences, health conditions, and fitness level.*


**At 65, you HAVE TO BECOME your own HEALTH provider ... YOU need to IMMERSE yourself in the improvement of your HEALTH.**  My own goal as a 65-year-old is to be the HEALTHIEST, FITTEST 70-year-old that I can possibly be ... I want to HEALTHIER tomorrow than I am today; healthier next week than I am this week, healthier next month than I am this month ... HEALTH has to be built through hourly, daily, weekly progression ... but building that progression is entirely about IMMERSION in the larger goal of becoming the PROVIDER of my own HEALTH.  In this particular post, we are focused on PROVIDING greater STRENGTH and CONDITIONING ... as part of the IMMERSION thinking in STRENGTH and CONDITIONING, as a 65-year-old man, I will need to spend a lot of time thinking about FLEXIBILITY and BALANCE to even be able to train to be stronger and to have better cardiovascular conditioning.  

Obviously, as I approach my 65th birthday, I should not exactly be interested in the goals of someone winning a national championship in college wrestling, HOWEVER when I look at the RESULTS of these top flight college sports programs, I definitely see the degree to which they DEPEND UPON really great strength and conditioning coaches ... top flight do not just hand players a few sheets or a little handbook with exercises and point the players to the weight room ... they have highly compensated professional strength and conditioning coaches who oversee the entire strength and conditioning program with staff responsible for coaching the players through the exercises and monitoring the players' progress in order to make daily, weekly, monthly adjustments in focus.

HEALTH has to come from IMMERSION. Immersion does mean swallowing pills or supplements. Being IMMERSED in health improvement is like being immersed in a language for the purposes of THINKING NATIVELY in that language ... we have to THINK in every moment about getting to be healthier.

Nobody learns TO THINK in a language as we all THINK as natives in our language by swallowing a pill.  We also do not learn to THINK as a NATIVE in a language by visiting some language professional four times a year OR every two weeks or EVEN once a day. The only way to really LEARN a language ... to THINK as a native speaker thinks in a language is through total IMMERSION.  If you want to provide yourself in GENUINE health -- you will need tp immerse yourself in the how you get healthy.  You PROVIDE better HEALTH for yourself in itsy bitsy baby steps ... in the same way that you recover from when you were VERY sick, ie at first, YOU JUST WORK AT FEELING BETTER IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES OR HOUR, you AVOID all of poisons and anything that does not help your health, so that build up your health and strength, so that you can even think about what can do so that the rest of the day goes better -- you  work at feeling better today, so that the week goes better ... you cannot DEVELOP better HEALTH by focusing on symptoms or pills or supplements or any of the typical medicial FEAR MONGERING.**

You need to IMMERSE yourself in the DEVELOPMENT of your own strength and conditioning program. For STARTERS, just to give you and outline of what to think about AT FIRST, you can ask an AI like CoPilot to [develop a strength and conditioning syllabus](https://sl.bing.net/dK3ib8cQvHE) to help you get started thinking about the discipline of developing better discipline by putting together a strength and conditioning program that *actually makes sense* FOR ME as I am IMMERSED IN THE THINKING about strength and condition ... if I am not IMMERSED in the topic so that I am THINKING about it, as a native language speaker THINKS in his native language ... there's no chance that the strength and conditioning program will be **something that I will actually do** ... without the IMMERSIION of THINKING about the DEVELOPMENT of the program, all that I will have is *just another asinine schedules of exercises or calisthenics that any junky, fritterware fitness app tells me I should do.*

So dive in to IMMERSION part of this ... we can start getting immersed by fleshing out the outline of the syllabus that CoPilot has developed for me ... I will need to think IN DETAIL about the following topics:

Of course, consistency and gradual progress are key ... if I don't NEED to make a few steps on the journey every day, I'm not just going to magically enjoy the stupid journey ... I don't need to stay motivated; motivation can't be on me -- it HAS TO BE something, like landscape architecture and gardening that I need to do every day ... the key to prioritizing safety throughout the process is all about the whole program being a series sort of small meaningful chores that need to get done every day -- that's why the whole strength and conditioning program has to involve gardening and landscaping ... because I don't give a fuck about getting in shape to make the football team.

The KEY really boils down to me having chores that I have to do every day ... I can turn off and ignore a stupid fitness app -- the real needs all about an IMMEDIATE WHY, something I HAVE TO DO, not a pop-up reminder from an app, but something REAL that needs attention, like a garden or an edible foodscaping project.  It has to be REAL ... something where I can see what I have done even it's just something like re-positioning the geraniums to give the ones that aren't blooming more sun and move the blooming ones into the shadier areas so their blooms last longer ... there has to be a PHYSICAL, immediate WHY implicit in a daily set of chores that reminds one why he even needs to even bother with strength and conditioning. It does not work to have a distant, off-in-the-future WHY, eg I don't want to die unfit -- **the distant, nebulous, off-in-the-future "it's good for you" WHY is just not close to being good enough for an old guy.**
