It's valentine's day and BETTER YET, it's Lent ... so this LENT ... how about if we try to  FALL IN LOVE with the perfect selves that we could be, if we would only get seriously about working on ourselves to be a more perfect Christ-like example of the human God created us to be. It will involve a lot of SACRIFICES and giving up things [at least temporarily] but that's what Lent is all about.

# This Lent ...

We can build our efforts ON TOP OF OUR [Strength, Conditioning, Mobility self-coaching syllabus](https://markbruns.github.io/template/2024/01/14/strength-conditioning-mobility-coaching.html) which we are in the process of developing ... because better health needs to be the physical foundation of our self-improvement program ... we are not going to compete in any sport, it's just that if we want to be better students or disciples, we should first provide the foundation of being more healthy and more fit so that we are even able to be good students or disciples.

Since I like the way that AI prompt me to ask way more questions, I started by asking CoPilot and Gemini to [curate a syllabus for a deep dive study of Lent including the most impactful spiritual, mental, and physical considerations for someone who is going to be especially serious for forty days about developing a plan for becoming like Christ or a more perfect modern-day example of the humans God created?](https://g.co/gemini/share/3ae1d74180ac).

The following outline was developed by CoPilot, Gemini ... with my own input and editing [which might make it worse, or too biased] but you can just click on the link ABOVE ... or copy the question into your favorite AI and see if you like that better.  It's not going to radically different than what you should expect, but an AI is good for mapping out a basic outline which you can modify, expand or re-prioritize to suit your own needs and circumstances.

## Week 1: Understanding Lent
- Introduction to Lent
- The Biblical basis for Lent
- The significance of the 40 days

## Week 2: Spiritual Considerations
- The role of prayer during Lent
- Fasting and its spiritual significance
- Almsgiving and service
## Week 3: Mental Considerations
- Developing positive habits
- Cultivating gratitude, joy, and openness
- Overcoming challenges and temptations
## Week 4: Physical Considerations
- The physical benefits of fasting
- Balancing physical and spiritual health
- Understanding the connection between physical actions and spiritual growth
## Week 5: Becoming Like Christ
- Understanding the call to Christlikeness
- Emulating Christ's attributes
- The role of the Holy Spirit in transformation
## Week 6: Modern-Day Examples
- Learning from modern-day examples of Christ-like living
- Applying lessons from these examples to your own life
## Week 7: Reflection and Preparation for Easter
- Reflecting on the journey of Lent
- Preparing your heart for the celebration of Easter

Now REMEMBER the GOAL of this is to deepen our understanding of Lent and use this forty period for FOCUSING on spiritual growth and transformation. What we have is only a starting outline [which will be a work-in-progress thoughout Lent].  We will modify this outline to suit our personal needs and circumstances ... and NEXT YEAR we might have a better outline for doing this again ***as an old AI tradition*** that we can always look forward to observing every year at Lent.
