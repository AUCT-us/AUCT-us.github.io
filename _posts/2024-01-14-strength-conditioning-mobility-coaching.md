Let's start off with a deeper dive on Gemini or Bard's answer for our question about [strength, conditioning, and mobility coaching for MALES OVER 65](https://g.co/bard/share/05a7387874fd) ... we can and also will use Gemini Advanced and Copilot and a bunch of other AI ... but the POINT of Strength, Conditioning, and Mobility Coaching is really META-cognition MENTAL STRENTH, MENTAL CONDITIONING, MENTAL MOBILITY, MENTAL COACHING exercise to start asking a LOT MORE questions ... and then to keep asking MORE and STILL MORE and EVEN STILL MORE questions.

Asking more and more and more questions allows us to IMMERSIVELY THINK in an important topic driving HEALTH ... such as Strength, Conditioning, and Mobility Coaching ... and, sure AI love [or at least never sick of] getting more questions ... the questions make the AI and the whole AI response ***better, faster, cheaper*** [ie, cheaper, in terms of resources consumed on the back end, even if the AI is "free" to use, the questions help tune it] for other people.

AI NEVER can get too many questions ... in a way that ANY human sifu, even the most patient of the patient sifu, will at some point, get sick and tired of the smart ass's questions ... but we should REMEMBER, part of the **reason** the human sifu gets sick of all of the questions is that the human sifu cares enough about you as a human to get pissed off at the questions.  At some point ... **YOU have to DO** ... no just try ... no askey more questions ... you have to DO the repetitions!

So DO the repetitions ... when you get tired, go back to the fundamentals ... ask Gemini, Copilot more questions ... first train in the preliminaries.
