AI, content, journalling, podcasting, doing the reps, are all part of the IMMERSION process of self-coaching and improving the discipline ones coaching in ANYTHING ... including like strength, conditioning, and mobility coaching ... serious coaching, especially the most serious form of coaching or SELF-COACHING ... is ALL about IMMERSION and about how we THINK.

AI is certainly changing the way that humans think ... just as Google, Wikipedia and Amazon changed the way that people search for information [and become insta-experts] ... just as printing press changed the way that people think about freedom and why humans are subjects why anyone should give any respect to the authority of the king. FREEDOM is not free ... and, sorry GI Joe fans, freedom didn't come from flag waving and the military ... freedom came from the the way that humans THINK and then do what they need to DO in order to USE VIOLENCE in order take back their freedom. Freedom is NOT free ... it will demand a SACRIFICE ***from you*** 

**The POINT of Strength, Conditioning, and Mobility Coaching is that ... you have to sacrifice part of your life in order to TRAIN in order to be ready to be VIOLENT THREAT to those who would take your freedom. **

Let's start off with a deeper dive on Gemini or Bard's answer for our question about [strength, conditioning, and mobility coaching for MALES OVER 65](https://g.co/bard/share/05a7387874fd) ... we can and also will use Gemini Advanced and Copilot and a bunch of other AI ... but the POINT of Strength, Conditioning, and Mobility Coaching is really META-cognition MENTAL STRENTH, MENTAL CONDITIONING, MENTAL MOBILITY, MENTAL COACHING exercise to start asking a LOT MORE questions ... and then to keep asking MORE and STILL MORE and EVEN STILL MORE questions.

Asking more and more and more questions allows us to IMMERSIVELY THINK in an important topic driving HEALTH ... such as Strength, Conditioning, and Mobility Coaching ... and, sure AI love [or at least never sick of] getting more questions ... the questions make the AI and the whole AI response ***better, faster, cheaper*** [ie, cheaper, in terms of resources consumed on the back end, even if the AI is "free" to use, the questions help tune it] for other people.

AI NEVER can get too many questions ... in a way that ANY human sifu, even the most patient of the patient sifu, will at some point, get sick and tired of the smart ass's questions ... but we should REMEMBER, part of the **reason** the human sifu gets sick of all of the questions is that the human sifu cares enough about you as a human to get pissed off at the questions.  At some point ... **YOU have to DO** ... no just try ... no askey more questions ... you have to DO the repetitions!

So DO the repetitions ... when you get tired, go back to the fundamentals ... ask Gemini, Copilot more questions ... first train in the preliminaries.

Then, at some point, talk about it ... remember ... [USE THE PODCASTERING PLAN](https://five.libsynsupport.com/hc/en-us/articles/5454952503195-About-the-Plan-Levels) ... as part of the IMMERSION process ... to THINK, internalize, DEVELOP the self-coaching and improve your discipline ... you can DO the reps in very little time, but if you really want to COACH yourself, you need to think and  to verbalize what you DO.  

The whole point of [podcastering FOR YOURSELF](https://five.libsyn.com/show) is about THINKING OUT LOUD and talking to yourself IN PUBLIC ... and then listening to yourself and then adjusting your thinking and your talking your way through what you are doing ... the WHOLE POINT is IMMERSION ... IMMERSION, IMMERSION, IMMERSION ... **it's all about THINKING**
