*For Christians, there can be no other day in the year that is more genuinely worthy of a SPECIAL day of celebration than Easter.*

No one's birthday ... or Christmas ... or July 4th ... or Veteran's Day or Memorial Day or any other day ... NO day is more WORTHY OF CELEBRATION than Easter. NONE.

Of course, we know that EVERY day is *special* in it's own snowflakey way ... it is best to live in the NOW, or possibly just slightly erring on the future side of now, in anticipation of the next now ... exercising to be better able to enjoy tomorrow's now or next month's now. ... but **NO day is more WORTHY OF CELEBRATION than Easter. NONE.**
