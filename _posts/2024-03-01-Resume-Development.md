*It's not really just LinkedIn ... not really just social media ... or various online profiles ... *it's about your IMAGE ... your NAME ... what superficial things, like your appearance or your LIKENESS ... and it's about your personal brand.*

I was not really looking for a job ... but I thought that going through the typical job search exercise might give me some clues about how I should *look for work* in retirement [to work for myself, starting at the bottom, as a retiree-intern].


So I [asked Bard some different questions to develop some different resume TEMPLATES for me](https://g.co/bard/share/8a05e2400b69) as if I were going to toss the ol' sombrero back in the ring and go back to work ... and Bard was EXCELLENT for getting an outline for getting me started BUT then ... 

... as I was going through the exercise of sort of putting some meat on the bones of resume's outlined skeletal structure, I eventually saw that my original question was not really sufficient, so I kept asking Bard more refining questions ... that prompt re-engineering was really a matter of refining MY thinking and better understanding my own thinking and more precisely what questions I really wanted to ask.

As I worked on this, I realized that I was really starting to understand my own goals and by asking questions of Bard, I was starting to get a much clearer, more concrete, understandable [for me] idea about precisely what I was looking for ini my job search ... *the biggest value of an AI assistant like Bard is to help someone get better at asking better questions* and then finally ...

# ***I understood that I had been approaching job search COMPLETELY WRONG for my entire career.***

*Great! Now that I'm retired and don't need to work anymore, I finally understand what my career should've been about!*

Do not get me wrong ... I am EXTREMELY grateful for the career that I had ... PARTICULARLY grateful for the PEOPLE I met during what was basically an unplanned succession of throw-away placeholder jobs while I was trying to figure my life out.  **I am EXTREMELY gratedful for the people.**

*But, I messed up.* Not really a crime ... and there was certainly nobody to blame but myself, but I see now how I should have approached it.

A big part of the problem, is that I had looked at the jobs that were available ... at an early point in my life, I looked at the jobs that were available within driving distance ... then I looked at jobs that I could get from my college recruiter or the local city's help wanted ads ... later I looked more broadly at job boards like Indeed ... and I tended to give up and accept what a headhunter offered me.

I could NEVER find my ideal job ... because I had settled for what I thought was available ... I settled because I had not bothered to REALLY, REALLY, REALLY refine my goals and objectives ... **I had settled for the ideas of what total dumbfucks were offering me.**

*I had become the dumbfuck who settled for the best available option.*  

I did not CREATE my options. 

I thought that I did ... but, if I am serious with myself, I have to admit that did NOT ever understand my own job search in the broader context of what I was **trying to accomplish** ... I had goals, career plans, things that I wanted to do ... but mostly, I showed up for work and pretty much saved almost every nickel of my paycheck to invest OR pay down debts of business entities that I had an interest in ... but I was MENTALLY lazy, in that I was comfortable just working at the same old thing ... RATHER THAN CONTINUALLY THINKING ABOUT MY GOALS AND REINVENTING MYSELF.

# Forget the Rear View Mirror -- What About The RETIREMENT GIG

I thoroughly DETEST being a tourist ... cannot stand it AT ALL. I enjoy seeing new things, interacting with new people, doing all of the things that one does when one travels ... but I CANNOT STAND doing that as a tourist. I can't explain why; I just know that it makes me nauseous and even ready to contemplate suicide. I have to have a business purpose to DRIVE the reason to see new things, to interact with new people, to travel and experience different cultures ... 

Without a business purpose, I am better off being a reclusive hermit at home ... maybe, if I want to meet interesting new people, I can visit the convicts in prison.

So ... it's either prison ... or else I have to INVENT my own business purpose ... or philanthropic purpose ... or else, I can't travel, see new things firsthand or interact with new people.
