## In like a LAMB, out like a LION!

***Selling yourself*** has to start with abject, genuine humility to convey a vibe of gentle harmlessness to get people to TALK ... so that you can hear what they have to say ... to which you add *almost mean,* listening (ie, the listening has to be **skeptical**, bordering on *mean* because people are generally decent, caring humans who have a tendency to tell you what they think you want to hear) ... but you have LISTEN with discipline, to be intently-focused in an especially-SHREWD listening when you are **selling yourself** ... you have to be seeking to fully understand the situation they need help with and the root causes for why it is what it is ... and then, when you have deterimined that you actually have something to sell, you must be relentless in selling yourself to the VERY VERY VERY FEW people who need your solution ... as if you were a LION who was going to die fighting for them.  

Perhaps, this LAMB-to-LION thing seems like a paradox ... but it's the only way to ***sell*** yourself ... and the important thing is not to sell yourself to the masses ... and not to be a slut about it ... there's no real problem with fame or being liked ... but when **you chase fame or when you try to be liked, you lose your soul.**

*Selling yourself is not really JUST your resume on some site like LinkedIn OR Crunchbase ... not JUST social media at all ... or JUST your various online profiles or model hubs or repositories or list of published papers* ... that's all part of the toolkit, but what matters is YOU and how you present the real YOU [in the virtual world] ... with the intention of solving the problems your Creator put you on Earth to solve.

People GET that **the virtual world is primarily, almost all crapware; which is WHY being different than just more crapware stands out so starkly**.

Selling yourself the correct way, that makes it clear that you are different and are not catering to being liked, is about the necessarily GENUINE, deeply AUTHTENTIC processes of selling the GENUINE you that you really are.*

What your should be SELLING is a genuine representation of your total package [including your content, repositories, commitgraph] of the percieved IMAGE of you as a continuous improvement engineer, a hyper-curious, constantly learning person who will try better ideas. 

Of course, that percieved image is something that you must constantly work on making REAL. Because it does get tied to things like your NAME, financial identity ... and the superficial things, like your appearance or your percieved LIKENESS. 

In the end, your personal brand does not really matter EXCEPT if you might need/want to help people do productive things *and, POSSIBLY be compensated fairily for your assistance to them* ... but you should never get yourself into a position where you NEED the money or NEED to be liked or NEED to be famous.

## Doing It The Wrong Way

My OLD LINKEDIN PROFILE ... which has been stagnant for at least 15 years ...had absolutely nothing to do with looking for a job or looking for new business ... it was kind of a SOCIAL profile for staying in touch with old colleagues and maybe meeting new people who shared my technical *EngineersWithoutBorders* or *OpenSourcist* interest in various philanthropic endeavors ... but basically, I just had not really figured out what LinkedIn was trying to be OR I wanted to accomplish with my LinkedIn profile ... *I was just sorta messing around because I had not even thought about what it might be for*.

So I started off [asking Bard some different questions to develop some different resume TEMPLATES for me](https://g.co/bard/share/8a05e2400b69) as if I were going to toss the ol' sombrero back in the ring and go back to work ... *sort of*, I was maybe interested in finding a startup [or set of startups] that I could advise on continuous improvement technical problem-solving or inventive **engineering** ... and an AI assistant was EXCELLENT for getting an outline QUICK for getting me STARTED thinking ... even though I still knew that I was just doing it wrong, and was *just trying to MORE RAPIDLY go through the same old job search motions* ... 

... as I was going through the exercise of sort of putting some meat on the bones of resume's outlined skeletal structure, I eventually saw that my original question was not really sufficient, so I kept asking different AI assistants more refining questions, because doing that was actually helping me THINK ... since the time spent on prompt re-engineering was really a matter of refining MY thinking and better understanding my own thinking and more precisely what questions I really wanted to ask.

As I worked on this more and more, I finally realized that I was really starting to understand my own goals and by asking questions of the AI, I was ***starting*** to actually have a conversation with myself about getting a much clearer, more concrete, understandable [for me] idea about precisely what I was looking for my MAYBE job search or MAYBE looking for startups to join ... along the way, I learned that *the biggest value of an AI assistant [so far] is to help someone get better at asking better questions* ... which is about having a conversation with yourself ... so that FINALLY ...

# ***I understood that I had been approaching job search COMPLETELY WRONG for my entire career.***

*Great! Now that I'm retired and don't need to work anymore, I finally understand what my career should've been about!*

Do not get me wrong ... I am EXTREMELY grateful for the career that I had and PARTICULARLY grateful for the PEOPLE I met ... and I need to emphasize that, ***I am PARTICULARLY grateful for the PEOPLE I met*** ... during what was basically an unplanned succession of throw-away placeholder jobs while I was trying to figure my life out.  **I am EXTREMELY gratedful for the people.** 

But, I am NOT really grateful for the jobs ... it's sorta like sports in school ... both the jobs that I held and the sports that I went out for in school were a TOTAL AND COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME! And to make matters worse, I sorta knew that at the time ... but I had not REALLY had a good conversation with myself to understand what I should do different ... but, my jobs and high school sports were not a complete waste, but ONLY because of the other people who were on my teams ... the activities/rewards of either my jobs OR the sports I played were a stupid use of my time ... maybe not as bad as the time I wasted in classrooms, but stupid enough. 

*So, I messed up.* Which is not really a crime ... and there was certainly nobody to blame but myself, but I see NOW how I should have approached it. *I should have asked myself MORE questions ... which would have led to me pushing much harder for things that matter ... and I should have spent a LOT less time worrying about being liked or having money or even being accepted.*

A big part of the problem, is that I limited myself by thinking that the range of opportunities was limited to the jobs that were available or even worse, the jobs from employers that I thought would hire me ... at an early point in my life, I looked at the jobs that were available within driving distance ... then, in college, I looked at jobs that I could get from my university recruiter or maybe the professional help wanted ads from cities that I wanted to live in ... later, I looked more broadly at job search boards like Monster or Indeed ... I networked a little bit with friends from college or old colleagues, but frankly, I sorta tended to just detest any kind of ***selling myself*** activities, so I just accepted what was out there OR, maybe worst of all, I allowed myself to be seduced by some headhunter telling me about an employer that sought ME out.

I could NEVER find my ideal job ... because I had settled for what I thought was available ... I settled because I had not bothered to REALLY, REALLY, REALLY refine my goals and objectives ... **I had settled for the ideas of what total dumbfucks were offering me.**

*I had become the dumbfuck who settled for the best available option.*  

I did not CREATE my options. 

I thought that I did ... but, if I am serious with myself, I have to admit that did NOT ever understand my own job search in the broader context of what I was **trying to accomplish** ... I had goals, career plans, things that I wanted to do ... but mostly, I showed up for work and pretty much saved almost every nickel of my paycheck to invest OR pay down debts of business entities that I had an interest in ... but I was MENTALLY lazy, in that I was comfortable just working at the same old thing ... RATHER THAN CONTINUALLY THINKING ABOUT MY GOALS AND REINVENTING MYSELF.

# Forget the Rear View Mirror -- What About The RETIREMENT GIG

I thoroughly DETEST being a tourist ... cannot stand it AT ALL. I enjoy seeing new things, interacting with new people, doing all of the things that one does when one travels ... but I CANNOT STAND doing that as a tourist. I can't explain why; I just know that it makes me nauseous and even ready to contemplate suicide. I have to have a business purpose to DRIVE the reason to see new things, to interact with new people, to travel and experience different cultures ... 

Without a business purpose, I am better off being a reclusive hermit at home ... maybe, if I want to meet interesting new people, I can visit the convicts in prison.

So ... it's either prison ... or else I have to INVENT my own business purpose ... or philanthropic purpose ... or else, I can't travel, see new things firsthand or interact with new people.
