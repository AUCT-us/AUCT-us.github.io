# Markets never waste new information

A "Schelling point mechanism" refers to a concept in game theory where, without prior communication, people tend to naturally converge on a specific solution or outcome because it seems most prominent or obvious to them, essentially acting as a focal point in a situation where coordination is needed; this concept is named after economist Thomas Schelling who extensively studied it in his work on conflict strategy. A focal point (or Schelling point) is a solution which is not really an optimal solution, but people tend to choose by default in the absence of communication in order to avoid coordination failure, *upsetting the apple cart* or disrupting the status quo or provoking revolution. The points about Schelling focal points: very little information used and communication is usually neither required or even desired. The key aspect is that individuals can arrive at the same expected cliche decision even without explicitly discussing it with others; the Schelling focal point is usually a choice that seems most likely to be chosen by others due to its inherent characteristics or cultural norms, ie it's the de facto starting point for any conversations or negotiations.

Schelling focal points are why unreviewed, pre-print arxiv papers are so NECESSARY ... **MARKETS NEVER WASTE NEW INFORMATION** even when it is not approved by peers OR maybe BECAUSE it is not approved by peers. **MARKETS NEVER WASTE NEW INFORMATION.**

Quantum error-correction technologies show us why errors/contradictions or understading what is NOT real or what cannot possibly be real can actually be an important part understanding Reality. **MARKETS NEVER WASTE NEW INFORMATION.**
