As a matter of PURE ENTERTAINMENT ... I enjoy the NFL Draft ... because it's about the evaluation of performance AND the differences between what different people see ... so FOR FUN ... and nothing but FUN ... I am going to compare my 2024 NFL Draft Order of QBs with the actual performance of those QBs in the 2024 season ...

# Draft Order of 2024 QBs

This is how the world sees the QBs in the 2024 draft:
1 (1) Caleb Williams USC
1 (2) Jayden Daniels LSU
1 (3) Drake Maye North Carolina
1 (8) Michael Penix Jr. Washington
1 (10) J.J. McCarthy Michigan
1 (12) Bo Nix Oregon
5 (15) Spencer Rattler South Carolina
5 (36) Jordan Travis Florida State
6 (17) Joe Milton III Tennessee
6 (42) Devin Leary Kentucky
7 (25) Michael Pratt Tulane


# Actual Performance of 2024 QBs in 2024 Season

This is my prediction of how the 2024 QBs will perform in the 2024 season ... my assessment is based on how well these QBs have done over their entire careers ... and how much hype has been applied to certain QBs (Caleb Williams)... and NOT to others (Joe Milton III) ...

2 Bo Nix Oregon ... starter from beginning, establishes himself early as solid QB1 for Denver

3 J.J. McCarthy Michigan ... eventually starter, does surprisingly well for being SO young, but then again he was 27-1 for Michigan, he shows signs of adding strength and committing to being a good game manager for the Vikings, probably future QB1 for MN

1 Michael Penix Jr. Washington ... starter after Cousins injured/benched early in season, firmly QB1 for Atlanta ... faces some adversity with aggravation of injury, but comes back strong and in charge, ie Cousins in QB2 and in mentor role

5 Michael Pratt Tulane ... backup, but starts later in season when Love injured, plays surprisingly well to get GB into playoffs

6 Spencer Rattler South Carolina ... backup, but starts later in season when Carr injured, makes mistakes, but has flashes of brillance, definitely an acceptable QB2 or better for future

7 Jordan Travis Florida State ... backup, but starts when Jets miss playoffs and Rodgers gives up, maybe QB1 for Jets in 2025  

8 Joe Milton III Tennessee ... backup to backup, QB3, but eventually starts and does well enough to becomes Pats QB1 after Maye struggles

9 Devin Leary Kentucky ... backup, never starts but seems solid as backup to Jackson

4 Drake Maye North Carolina ... backup, but relatively early start, struggles, becomes QB2 for Patriots

10 Jayden Daniels LSU ... disappointing bust (eg Bryce Young; tries almost too hard but likely to get hurt), Washington gets #1 pick in 2025 draft

11 Caleb Williams USC ... bigger disappointing bust (eg Zach Wilson; busts with bad attitude), Chicago gets #2 pick in 2025 draft, but only because Tyson Bagent emerges as a solid QB1 for the Bears
