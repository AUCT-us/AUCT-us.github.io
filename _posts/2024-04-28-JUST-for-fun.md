As a matter of PURE ENTERTAINMENT ... I enjoy the NFL Draft ... much moreso than games ... because it's the CULMINATION of YEARS of ridiculous athletic achievement.

But ... what makes it FUN to me has do with the differences of opinions ... and how people shape their opinions of HIGHLY UNCERTAIN future outcomes ... so it's WAY BETTER than just a game ... it's about how people evaluate what kinds of success high level athletes will have in the future.

So for me ... it's about PURE FUN ... because I don't have anything at stake in the different outcomes. 

It's PURELY about about the evaluation of FUTURE performance AND the differences between what I see and what different other people see.  It's PURELY about the FUN of evaluating FUTURE PERFORMANCE ... and nothing but FUN ... NO BETTING. 

So FOR FUN ... I am going to compare my 2024 NFL Draft Order of QBs with the actual performance of those QBs in the 2024 season ... **SPOILER ALERT** ... I fully expect that my predictions will be WAY OFF; some might not be; but others will be ... but it's just for FUN.

# Draft Order of 2024 QBs

This is how the world sees the QBs in the 2024 draft:
1 (1) Caleb Williams USC
1 (2) Jayden Daniels LSU
1 (3) Drake Maye North Carolina
1 (8) Michael Penix Jr. Washington
1 (10) J.J. McCarthy Michigan
1 (12) Bo Nix Oregon
5 (15) Spencer Rattler South Carolina
5 (36) Jordan Travis Florida State
6 (17) Joe Milton III Tennessee
6 (42) Devin Leary Kentucky
7 (25) Michael Pratt Tulane


# Actual Performance of 2024 QBs in 2024 Season

This is my prediction of how the 2024 QBs will perform in the 2024 season ... my assessment is based on how well these QBs have done over their entire careers ... and how much hype has been applied to certain QBs (Caleb Williams)... and NOT to others (Joe Milton III) ... in a nutshell, I don't care for hype and I tend to STRONGLY resist the conventional wishdom based on hype. (But I do get that sometimes there are valid reasons for the hype ... it's just that I'd like to see more data/evidence behind the hype, eg *HOW did USC LOSE to Tulane in the 2023 Cotton Bowl?*)

2 Bo Nix Oregon ... starter from beginning, establishes himself early as solid QB1 for Denver ... Bo was solid enough at Auburn, but really matured to be ridiculously good for Oregon.

3 J.J. McCarthy Michigan ... eventually starter, does surprisingly well for being SO young, but then again JJ was 27-1 for Michigan ... if he shows signs of adding strength and committing to being a SMART game manager/field general for the Vikings ... IF he does that especially on the SMART game mgmt side, JJ's probably future QB1 for MN for a long time.

1 Michael Penix Jr. Washington ... starter after Cousins injured/benched early in season, firmly QB1 for Atlanta ... faces some adversity with aggravation of injury, but comes back strong and in charge, ie Cousins in QB2 and in mentor role ... Penix will likely be the future QB1 for the Falcons, UNLESS he gets some sort of career-ending injury; he's probably the TOUGHEST QB in the draft, but he might be the most injury-prone because of his propensity to tough out playing and taking the risk of competing while not at his best ... the Penix/Cousin combo could emerge as super-QB tandem, if they can work together.

5 Michael Pratt Tulane ... backup at first, but starts later in season when Love injured, then plays surprisingly well [maybe better than Love has] to get GB into playoffs

6 Spencer Rattler South Carolina ... backup, but starts later in season when Carr injured, makes mistakes in forcing some plays, but also has flashes of brillance, definitely an acceptable QB2 or even better for future

7 Joe Milton III Tennessee ... backup to backup, QB3, but eventually starts and does well enough to becomes Pats QB1 after Maye struggles

8 Jordan Travis Florida State ... backup, but starts when Jets miss playoffs and Rodgers gives up, maybe QB1 for Jets in 2025  

9 Devin Leary Kentucky ... backup, never actually starts but looks ready and seems solid as backup to Jackson, playing in games when Ravens are ahead and saving Jackson from injury

4 Drake Maye North Carolina ... backup, but relatively early start, struggles, doesn't make big mistakes, but underwhelms, becomes QB2 for Patriots

10 Jayden Daniels LSU ... disappointing bust (eg Bryce Young; hard to blame either one; tries almost too hard but likely to get hurt), Washington gets #1 pick in 2025 draft and challenges Carolina for the cellar dweller role

11 Caleb Williams USC ... bigger disappointing bust (eg Zach Wilson; busts with bad attitude and tendency to force passes rather than punt and ends up getting intercepted), Chicago gets #2 pick in 2025 draft, but only because Tyson Bagent wins some games and emerges as a solid QB1 for the Bears
