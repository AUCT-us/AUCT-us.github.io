**What if we take the relationships and connections in OUR workflow and reimagined OUR professional project life along data-driven algorithmic critical chain relationships? What would our project management skills and daily look like if ALL of the people with who we were collaborating on the same version-controlled Ã‚roadmap?** Workflow should be driven by FLOW of work using Git. **How can more transparent and equitable organizations give professionals more feedback AND control over their Gitflow?**"


It is very important to understand that Git is not just about software ... Git will change the workflow of ANYONE doing ANY kind knowledge work [if it hasn't already].




The Git workflow radically changes or ELIMINATES meetings ... conversations about writing/editing/issues in using code/content in repositories gravitate toward a continually transcripted chat-driven 24x7 conversation with repository-centric chat tools like Gitter ... Git is also changing the way that professionals are managed [because everyone can see who is doing what when, so team structures get a lot flatter] AND Git changes the way those professionals develop resumes or portfolios of their collaborative work history.





Git software didn't exist just a little 10 years ago; it was created for the Linux kernel, but Git's impact will probably be larger than Linux -- because of how Git provides for distributed, decentralized team workflows for geographically-dispersed teams

Github [the largest host of Git repositories] provides for a common, standardized, hyper-efficient Git workflow ... the Github workflow is so efficient because it applies seamlessly as developers or authors switch to OTHER open source projects and other teams that are using GitHub ... Github has had a GIGANTIC impact on software development in the last five years and this impact is expanding ... all kinds of knowledge workers who write books or develop any kind of content collaboratively are moving to Git and Github  ... it is worth reading the account of Github's rise on Wired magazine to understand the larger significance of what Github is about.


With Git all authors participating in a project have version-controlled copies of the entire project repository [or repositories] on their own local machines.  Git manages the edits/revisions while providing full tracking of exactly who did what to the code or text document ... Git also retains all branches or forks -- ALL of the creation/edit/revision/merge history is there, so there don't have to be any worries about deletions or unwanted changes.  This allows for COMFORTABLY adopting a radically decentralized, distributed workflow for dispersed teams as well as meshing people with unconventional schedules (eg nightowls collaborating with early-risers and normal people with 9-to-5 jobs who code after hours).


It is important to reiterate that Github is ONLY one host of open source Git databases ... there are other hosts, but there are very solid reasons why Github has rapidly become the largest host using the Git software, not all of those reasons are in the Wired article -- one BIG reason is GitHub's CIO Scott Chacon, how incredibly deep his knowledge of Git was before anyone else's AND how hard Chacon is now driving Github to increase the depth of its knowledge of Git even further by looking at how GitHub users break the system with edge cases, boundary conditions, runaway code and all sorts of unique issues that pop up on the radar screen of a host with Github's scale ... the Git software that is used for these databases is itself an open source project and there are plenty of other Git hosts who can step in if Github falters or changes.  

If you want to learn more about Git, the best resource is Chacon's book, ProGit2 ... it's available as a free download for Kindle (mobi) or Apple iBooks (epub) or PDF or HTML5 or ... the full source of ProGit2 [prior to publishing] is available as a GitHub repo.  The GitHub guys really "eat their own dog food" when it comes to their fanatical belief in open source and transforming workflows with Git ... and their philosophical freeopensourcedness of "giving it all away" has probably caused a lot journos, experts and other dinosaurs to dismiss how big of a deal GitHub is ... it is very important to understand that Github and Git are not just about software.
