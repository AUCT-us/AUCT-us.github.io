If you want a label, I would label myself as an [anarcho-capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism) ... anyone who really wants to be be labeled as a anarchist needs to not just criticize but practically CREATE a better world -- anarchists have to stop whining and start inventing the paths to a truly voluntary and peaceful anarchy.  Irresponsible goofballs will prep for some sort of apocalyptic revolution but that's an idiotic waste of time.  There is PRACTICAL HARD REAL work to do ... we need to get serious and focus on creating a world based on leadership rather than fear, a culture that outgrows, outcompetes without the coercion of the State.  We need to think hard about how we would ever be we able to make truly free markets and private property work without Big Brother.  How would we be able to allocate resources, track ownership of assets, hold each other accountable and establish the necessary TRUST NETWORKS to form the basis of a productive, voluntary culture?  

Anarchy will certainly be no utopia but it will be a culture of greater freedom, responsibility and independence and it will come about because cultures that allow and expect their citizens to be more free, more repsonsible, more independent will always dominate those cultures that use fear, intimidation and culture to abuse and undermine the productivity of their citizens.  

A crytpo-anarchic approach relying upon cryptographic security and blockchain distributed database technology might help us get there ... there are certainly those who see a large role for blockchain distributed database technologies.  We can expect that the processes that humans go through as they continue to mature and grow up to be responsible anarchists will be messy, chaotic, far from easy. There are probably at least ten billion paths for how we can get to a more anarcho-capitalist world with 50 or 500 years, but we should be looking at and learning from really PRACTICAL examples that are working extremely well for people right now. Survival of the fittest probably requires us to be smart enough to adapt, to create and to love rather than being brutal and numb enough to conquer, destroy and kill.

We should start by considering how we could manage our work togther without the fear, coercion and threat of firing normally found many workplaces.  **How can more transparent and equitable organizations give professionals more feedback AND control over their workflow?**"  What if we take the relationships and connections in OUR workflow and reimagined OUR professional project life along data-driven algorithmic critical chain relationships? What would our project management skills and daily look like if ALL of the people with who we were collaborating on the same version-controlled roadmap? The practical experience of the most successful emergent firms on the planet right now suggest that the way that we think about systems and workflow should be driven by a FLOW of work that has been made possible by the [professional use of Git database technology](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).


It is very important to understand that Git is not just about software ... Git will change the workflow of ANYONE doing ANY kind knowledge work [if it hasn't already].




The Git workflow radically changes or ELIMINATES meetings ... conversations about writing/editing/issues in using code/content in repositories gravitate toward a continually transcripted chat-driven 24x7 conversation with repository-centric chat tools like Gitter ... Git is also changing the way that professionals are managed [because everyone can see who is doing what when, so team structures get a lot flatter] AND Git changes the way those professionals develop resumes or portfolios of their collaborative work history.





Git software didn't exist just a little 10 years ago; it was created for the Linux kernel, but Git's impact will probably be larger than Linux -- because of how Git provides for distributed, decentralized team workflows for geographically-dispersed teams

Github [the largest host of Git repositories] provides for a common, standardized, hyper-efficient Git workflow ... the Github workflow is so efficient because it applies seamlessly as developers or authors switch to OTHER open source projects and other teams that are using GitHub ... Github has had a GIGANTIC impact on software development in the last five years and this impact is expanding ... all kinds of knowledge workers who write books or develop any kind of content collaboratively are moving to Git and Github  ... it is worth reading the account of Github's rise on Wired magazine to understand the larger significance of what [Github](http://www.wired.com/tag/github/) is about.


With Git all authors participating in a project have version-controlled copies of the entire project repository [or repositories] on their own local machines.  Git manages the edits/revisions while providing full tracking of exactly who did what to the code or text document ... Git also retains all branches or forks -- ALL of the creation/edit/revision/merge history is there, so there don't have to be any worries about deletions or unwanted changes.  This allows for COMFORTABLY adopting a radically decentralized, distributed workflow for dispersed teams as well as meshing people with unconventional schedules (eg nightowls collaborating with early-risers and normal people with 9-to-5 jobs who code after hours).


It is important to reiterate that Github is ONLY one host of open source Git databases ... there are other hosts, but there are very solid reasons why Github has rapidly become the largest host using the Git software, not all of those reasons are in the Wired article -- one BIG reason is GitHub's CIO Scott Chacon, how incredibly deep his knowledge of Git was before anyone else's AND how hard Chacon is now driving Github to increase the depth of its knowledge of Git even further by looking at how GitHub users break the system with edge cases, boundary conditions, runaway code and all sorts of unique issues that pop up on the radar screen of a host with Github's scale ... the Git software that is used for these databases is itself an open source project and there are plenty of other Git hosts who can step in if Github falters or changes.  

If you want to learn more about Git, the best resource is Chacon's book, ProGit2 ... it's available as a free download for Kindle (mobi) or Apple iBooks (epub) or PDF or HTML5 or ... the full source of ProGit2 [prior to publishing] is available as a GitHub repo.  The GitHub guys really "eat their own dog food" when it comes to their fanatical belief in open source and transforming workflows with Git ... and their philosophical freeopensourcedness of "giving it all away" has probably caused a lot journos, experts and other dinosaurs to dismiss how big of a deal GitHub is ... it is very important to understand that Github and Git are not just about software.
