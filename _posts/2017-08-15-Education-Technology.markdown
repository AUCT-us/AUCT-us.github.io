Education technology, or the technology of assisting students in developing their skills in learning how to learn and continually improving their ability to learn how to learn is one of [my philanthropic venture](http://markbruns.github.io/philanthropy/mvp/opensource/2017/07/15/Venture-Philanthropy.html)  areas ... some of this is not really much more than in the formats for sharing ideas or executable notebooks to analyze data or various ways to improve channels for messaging and collaboration. A different facet of this involes natural language processing and computational forensics ... for example, the work on the analysis of writing, not just for assessing comprehension but even what the choice of simple words like the choice of pronouns says about an author's view of the world.

As a measurement engineer, one of my particular areas of technological interest involves assistive technologies and measurement technologies ... I am referring to sensors and systems of sensours or things like virtual reality or augmented reality as well as EEG neuroheadsets, MRIs and various neuroimaging technologies. I really don't know if these are really game-changing technologies or not -- but they certainly are intriguing and they will be more interesting as they are rolled out to a much wider audience of early adopters and more people play with the technologies and find new uses for them. This takes time, or perhaps more accurately, it takes a lot of use and experimentation and crowd-driven inspiration of better use, but eventually we might see some really compelling uses for how people learn, share ideas, collaborate and how these uses change with aging, injuries or the use of different substances that change neurochemistry. For example, it has taken awhile to develop but there is now a robust and growing scientific literature about [harnessing the power of event related [brain] potential (ERP) to study language, learning and development of the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4052444/).

It is more clear than ever that it is no longer possible to think about the brain or neurological development as merely a sophisticated computer composed of circuits prefabricated by genes ... in other words, the old educational paradigms that are based on the idea that education is as simple as coming up with a better classroom are blatantly flawed. Educational technologies certainly should not be about simply programming or indocintrating a young mind with the *proper knowledge* ... never mind that even a cursory consideration of history should tell us that we do not have the start of a beginning of a concept of a notion of what the *proper knowledge* should be and we NEVER will have that knowledge ... we do not even really know that much about how learning happens yet ... except that we do know that the humans beings who learn most are those who attempt to understand how others learn as they teach others. Human education is a deeply recursive, deeply collaborative, deeply adaptive topic ... we are still learning how to learn and the more that we recognize that education is about developing the skills to learn how to learn [throughout life], the more effective we will be in our attempts to educate and our attempts to develop educational technologies.
