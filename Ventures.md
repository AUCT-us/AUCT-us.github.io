***Venturing*** is our process of ACTIVE LEARNING about endeavors that advance human productivity. 

We can and do look at better intelligence gathering systems so we can better [study the common factors driving the 1200 or so billion-dollar startup unicorns that have come into existence in the last ten to twenty years](https://g.co/gemini/share/44bceab7d627) ... but MOSTLY we are interested in the kinds of ventures that can grow into being million-dollar startups that will grow into ten-million and hundred-million dollar startups on their way to being unicorns.

Active intelligence gathering and learning means getting our hands dirty and finding the areas of frustration and pain ... by actually DOING THINGS and BUILDING THINGS [at zero or very low cost] ... with the ***ultimate intention of making serious investments in things that actually make human beings better off. ***

## We do ventures in order PRIMARILY to research investment themes

EXCEPT that ... but VENTURES must create value for their users; so the best ventures of the next decade will necessarily be about SUSTAINABLE philanthropy.

There is no form of sustainable philanthropy that is better than something that can be built that will serve customers by improving customer productivity WITHOUT causing any negative externalities or pollutants and will do this EFFICIENTLY without burning up ANY [or very many] resources ... quite often, the ***very best thing that any human endeavor could possibly do is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, ie to just sit back and watch as we let our Creators process work in the Universe.***

We efficiently develop **near-zero-cost proto-ventures** in order understand an industry and understand which are the best long-term competitors in an industry and to invest in superior organizations ... if we cannot find a superior organization, we ***MIGHT*** attempt to create one from scratch, but PRIMARILY we are doing ventures to research an investment theme or thesis. 

***Venturing*** is our process of ACTIVE LEARNING ... getting dirty by actually DOING THINGS and BUILDING THINGS [at zero or very low cost] ... the point is to understand the issues that impede productivity growth for masses of human beings ... thus reserching, learing, building things that might work [or finding out why the ideas don't work] is about ***engaging*** the world economically, culturally, thematically ... *rather than simply being drunken tourist sunning ourselves on a beach*.

We try to do VENTURES in an intensely practical, near-zero-cost-to-launch manner ... by exploring possible business enterprise ideas (ie, self-sustaining ventures with products that offer customers something they need and will pay for or what is generally referred to as *the MVP with a compelling value proposition*) ... but we also look at creative or scientific research or different open source venture philantropies that could really move the needle.  We strongly favor open source.

# Listing of ventures 

Our aim is to read and use curated lists and AI to read faster, more broadly, more deeply, to discern patterns better ... we dogfood our reading in order to assist us in gathering intelligence ... our goal is to have roughly 100-200 brainstormed in the hopper, that's what our annotified curating reading lists are for  ... we actually only focus on about 10-20 venture themes each a month ... but, in practice, we try to *only one FOCUS on damned thing at a time.*
