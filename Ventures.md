***Venturing*** is our process of ***engaging*** the world economically, culturally, thematically.  

We try to do this in an intensely practical manner ... by exploring possible business enterprise ideas (ie, self-sustaining ventures with products that offer customers something they need and will pay for or what is generally referred to as *the MVP with a compelling value proposition*) ... but we also look at creative or scientific research or different open source venture philantropies that could really move the needle.  We strongly favor open source.

# Listing of ventures 

Our aim is to read and use curated lists and AI to read faster, more broadly, more deeply, to discern patterns better ... we dogfood our reading in order to assist us in gathering intelligence ... our goal is to have roughly 100-200 brainstormed in the hopper, that's what our annotified curating reading lists are for  ... we actually only focus on about 10-20 venture themes each a month ... but, in practice, we try to *only one FOCUS on damned thing at a time.*
