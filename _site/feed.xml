        <title>Pine64</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My Pine64 boards showed up last week … actually before I expected to receive them … I have come to expect people who organize and run crowdfunding campaigns for hardware underestimate how difficult it will be to meet any significant project deadline … hardware is HARD.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lean Government</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Most people believe in government in the same way that four-year-olds believe in Santa Claus.  They believe because the rest of the human species has lied to them and it has never occurred to them that they had a choice in questioning their belief in government.  So governments persist … for the same reason that any group of four-year-olds will persist in their belief in Santa Claus – nothing will derail that that belief, because the four-year-olds WANT to believe in Santa … governments persist because people DESPERATELY, HOPELESSLY, UNFAILINGLY need to believe in governments [because deep down, they’re all little kids who still really WANT to believe in Santa].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments have ALWAYS existed to protect the interests of powerful people … powerful people use media, propaganda, moral suasion, expert liars and every last trick in the book to tell ALL people that government is a social contract protecting ALL people … that is a LIE.  Governments protect powerful people and even powerful people don’t want the bullshit that comes with being a tyrant 24x7. This is NOT something that can ever be changed – the human species will be extinct BEFORE powerful people stop using ruses like government to control and manipulate other human beings.  That is the way it is … Death and extinction are certain, but until then we will have governments coercively using their monopoly on violence to control human beings and collect taxes from them in order to pay for those doing the control.  Right or wrong – the existence of government will be a CERTAINTY until human beings are extinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does technology have to do with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government does not have to be inefficient … even if the gross inefficiency of government will probably be what ultimately brings about the mass annihilation of all humans and other lifeforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government does not have to be coercive … believe it or not, instead of broadcasting propaganda to the masses, a government could actually LISTEN to what individual human beings want in order to boost the efficiency of government.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prediction Markets</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe much in polls anymore … it’s not just that the polling data is limited to the people who are in the phone database of the pollsters; most people really HATE to be polled and accordingly have all kinds of incentives for telling pollsters everything other than the truth just so that the pollster will leave them alone.  The big reason that I detest polls is the euphoric over-reaction that people have following media hype and mainstream media news coverage – TEMPORARILY hot candidates do much better in polls than prediction markets.  Prediction market traders see past the hype and discount for future success and/or failure, not just current standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe in prediction markets because prediction markets are driven by knowledgable people who want to trade or bet real hard-earned cash on their insights.  As we might expect prediction markets are extremely accurate indication of where the electorate is at a given time – the prediction markets result from election day almost always matches up exactly with the final result before the networks have called the election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s look at prediction markets … first look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.predictwise.com/politics/2016RepNomination&quot;&gt;current GOP Presidential nomination race&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.predictwise.com/node/4174&quot;&gt;September 8 2105&lt;/a&gt; … Bush, Rubio, Trump … the Establishment front-runner Bush appears to be weak&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.predictwise.com/node/4184&quot;&gt;September 16 2105&lt;/a&gt; … Bush, Trump, Rubio … the Establishment front-runner Rubio is sliding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.predictwise.com/node/4187&quot;&gt;September 17 2105&lt;/a&gt; … Bush, Rubio, Trump … the Establishment front-runner Rubio is sliding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.predictwise.com/node/4212&quot;&gt;September 27 2105&lt;/a&gt; … Bush, Rubio, Trump … the Establishment front-runner Rubio is sliding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.predictwise.com/node/4222&quot;&gt;October 4 2105&lt;/a&gt; … Bush, Rubio, Trump … the Establishment front-runner Rubio is sliding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.predictwise.com/node/4234&quot;&gt;October 11 2105&lt;/a&gt; … Bush, Rubio, Trump … the Establishment front-runner Bush has been almost overtaken by Rubio&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.predictwise.com/node/4247&quot;&gt;October 18 2105&lt;/a&gt; … Rubio, Bush, Trump  … the Establishment front-runner is now Rubio&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.predictwise.com/node/4263&quot;&gt;October 25 2105&lt;/a&gt; … Rubio, Bush, Trump … Bush continues to slide&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.predictwise.com/node/4277&quot;&gt;November 1 2105&lt;/a&gt; … Rubio, Trump, Bush … Bush is overtaken by Trump&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.predictwise.com/node/4290&quot;&gt;November 8 2105&lt;/a&gt; … Rubio, Trump, Cruz … Bush is overtaken by Cruz who has 12%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.predictwise.com/node/4305&quot;&gt;November 15 2105&lt;/a&gt; … Rubio, Trump, Cruz … Rubio climbs to 48%, Trump 19%, Cruz 13%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.predictwise.com/node/4314&quot;&gt;November 22 2105&lt;/a&gt; …  Rubio, Trump, Cruz … Rubio still at 48%, Trump 22% (which may be Trump’s peak), Cruz 13%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.predictwise.com/node/4325&quot;&gt;November 29 2105&lt;/a&gt; … Rubio, Trump, Cruz … the Establishment front-runner Rubio appears to have peaked at 48%, Trump 24%, Cruz 14%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.predictwise.com/node/4340&quot;&gt;December 6 2105&lt;/a&gt; …  Rubio, Trump, Cruz … the Establishment front-runner Rubio at 40% is sliding, Trump at 27% (which also may be Trump’s peak), Cruz at 15%&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning to Reinvent</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a starter list … read it over, agree/disagree, change it, improve it, reinvent your own list for reinventing yourself.  This one is mine [in its current revision]; I &lt;em&gt;plageurized, cheated, stole&lt;/em&gt; and reinvented it after reading and re-reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2013/12/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-reinventing-yourself-2/&quot;&gt;James Altucher’s THE ULTIMATE CHEAT SHEET FOR REINVENTING YOURSELF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A) Learn to &lt;em&gt;plageurize, cheat, steal&lt;/em&gt; but make the REINVENTION your OWN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OWN your life. Put that life together with the free stuff that you find laying around, but do not just accumulate a pile of junk.  Shaping the stuff that you have laying around into your reinvented future takes ingenuity, vision and EFFORT.  Fixing and polishing your reinvented life is not easy before it is a success; get used to being second-guessed and disrepected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B) Worry about NOW. 5S your life. Focus on your health, your breathing, your diet, the small details.  Fall in love with the person you are becoming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by moving the needle on your level of fitness and productivity, so that you have more time and energy to tackle other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take baby steps, but program yourself each day to have better habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C) Reinvention never stops … start today, but realize that you cannot reinvent yourself in a month or a year, you need to work a five-year plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’a all about the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. Every day, every week, every month, every year you need to invest a small amount of time in checking your progress doing what you’ve planned, taking action to bring your performance in line with the plan, then re-calibrating the plan and doing it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a description of what you might expect in the five year plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year One: you are flailing, drinking from the firehose, reading and absorbing everything, you are learning fast, but you’re a like baby … life is tough.
Year Two: you are still “selling snake oil” but know who you need to talk to and network with, i.e. you understand the movers, dice, cards and board layout of your new game.
Year Three: your plan is good enough to start making some money, but it isn’t anything to brag about and probably is not a living yet.
Year Four: your plan is providing an okayish living
Year Five: your plan is starting to compound and give you indications that it might generate real wealth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it works better, faster than that, great … but don’t expect and prepare yourself mentally for it to be worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D) Give everything away; ditch your baggage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanna be more effing tough, you need to develop the SKILLS to be able to continually start from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screw pride! Waste your time in dick measuring contests and your core competency is LOSING dick measuring contests. #TheresAlwaysABiggerDick&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E) You need a mentor of some sort another.  You also need to mentor others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are all kinds of mentors; here are three archetypes … there are more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Respected master. Be EXTREMELY CAREFUL. Do NOT join a cult. Certainly do no seek to be a cult leader … be careful when others follow you.
2) Indirect. Books, podcasts, vlogs, blogs, social media
3) Ordinary “average joe.””  Everyone has unique skill, knowledge about something. Every person could be your mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F) Program yourself to not be passive and programmed, be more skeptical, ask more questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THINK! Become a listening leader – seek out people who are DIFFERENT than you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G) Be more humble. You are not humble enough right now, you will be humiliated. Get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think you can reinvent yourself easier, faster, better or without giving up everything – then you too damned arrogant, too full of pride, not really ready, willing or able to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do NOT succumb to your own PR and start imagining that you walk on water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H) It’s not about the money … well, okay to some degree it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people say “it’s not about the money” they should make sure they have a different measuring stick; money is not a bad measuring stick to start with, but you need a better WHY than just money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What about just doing what you love?” There will be many days when you don’t love what you are doing. If you are doing it just for love then it will take much much longer than five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happiness is just a positive perception from our brain. Some days you will be unhappy. Our brain is a tool we use. It’s not who we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I) When can you say, “I do X!” where X is your new career or your new enterprise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J) When can I start doing X?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read … listen to mentors, but don’t waste all day reading.
Write … dream, but don’t spend all day dreaming … write down your dreams and start sketching out a plan.
Plan-Do-Check-Act … start spec-ing out the idea for your business/life. Get going today. Get up tomorrow and do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K) How will this business or new life of mine ever make money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, it won’t you will have to scramble for a couple years, working at other jobs or somehow scraping together the money to live on and begin starting your business.  Starting a business necessarily involves doing OTHER things … full-time … stop believing that you are entitled to be carried while you start your business … you don’t get to watch televison or relax anymore if you want to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first “alpha” year, you must reconceive your customer – to do this you have to work doing the research to develop a competitive situational awareness in your niche to understand what you will need to do to be one of the best 200-300 people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second “beta” year, you will work hard at doing what you need to do to launch your prototype product or service and then correcting the flaws so that you move beyond the “beta” level to begin getting solid paying customers and building your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By year three you’ve put in 5,000-7,000 hours and you launch the real deal … something that is good enough to be in the top 200-300 in the world in anything. The top 200 in almost any field makes a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By year four you will scale that up and polish to take out the non-value-added distractions to allow you to make a decent, comfortable living. Some people stop at year four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By year five you’re in the top 30-50 so you can actually invest in compounding your succcess to make genuine wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M) What is “it”? How do I know what I should do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever area you feel like reading 500 books about. Go to the bookstore and find it. If you get bored three months later go back to the bookstore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s okay to get disillusioned. That’s what failure is about. Success is better than failure but the biggest lessons are found in failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very important: There’s no rush. You will reinvent yourself many times in an interesting life. You will fail to reinvent many times. That’s fun also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many reinventions make your life a book of stories instead of a textbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people want the story of their life to be a textbook. For better or worse, mine is a book of stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why reinvention happens every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N) The choices you make today will be in your biography tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make interesting choices and you will have an interesting biography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N1) The choices you make today will be in your biology tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O) What if I like something obscure? Like biblical archaeology or 11th-century warfare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeat all of the steps above, and then in year five you will make wealth. We have no idea how. Don’t look to find the end of the road when you are still at the very first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fall&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P) What if my family wants me to be an accountant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many years of your life did you promise your family? Ten years? Your whole life? Then wait until the next life. The good thing is: you get to choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose freedom over family. Freedom over preconceptions. Freedom over government. Freedom over people-pleasing. Then you will be pleased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q) My mentor wants me to do it HIS way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s fine. Learn HIS way. Then do it YOUR way. With respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully nobody has a gun to your head. Then you have to do it their way until the gun is put down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R) My spouse is worried about who will support/take care of kids?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after you work 16 hours a day, seven days a week being a janitor, use your spare time to reinvent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone who is reinventing ALWAYS has spare time. Part of reinvention is collecting little bits and pieces of time and re-carving them the way you want them to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S) What if my friends think I’m crazy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T) What if I want to be an astronaut?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not a reinvention. That’s a specific job. If you like “outer space” there are many careers. Richard Branson wanted to be an astronaut and started Virgin Galactic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U) What if I like to go out drinking and partying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read this post again in a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V) What if I’m busy cheating on my husband or wife or betraying a partner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read this post again in two or three years when you are broke and jobless and nobody likes you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;W) What if I have no skills at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read “B” again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X) What if I have no degree or I have a useless degree?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read “B” again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y) What if I have to focus on paying down my debt and mortgage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read “R” again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Z) How come I always feel like I’m on the outside looking in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein was on the outside looking in. Nobody in the establishment would even hire him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone feels like a fraud at some point. The highest form of creativity is born out of skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AA) I can’t read 500 books. What one book should I read for inspiration?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BB) What if I’m too sick to reinvent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reinvention will boost every healthy chemical in your body: serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin. Keep moving forward and you might not get healthy but you will get healthier. Don’t use health as an excuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, reinvent your health first. Sleep more hours. Eat better. Exercise. These are key steps to reinvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CC) What if my last partner screwed me and I’m still suing him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop litigating and never think about him again. Half the problem was you, not him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DD) What if I’m going to jail?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect. Reread “B.” Read a lot of books in jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EE) What if I’m shy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make your weaknesses your strengths. Introverts listen better, focus better, and have ways of being more endearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FF) What if I can’t wait five years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you plan on being alive in five years then you might as well start today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GG) How should I network?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make concentric circles. You’re at the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next circle is friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next circle is online communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circle after that is meetups and coffees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circle after that is conferences and thought leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circle after that is mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circle after that is customers and wealth-creators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start making your way through the circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HH) What happens when I have ego about what I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 6-12 months you’ll be back at “B”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;II) What if I’m passionate about two things? What if I can’t decide?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combine them and you’ll be the best in the world at the combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JJ) What if I’m so excited I want to teach what I’m learning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start teaching on YouTube. Start with an audience of one and see if it builds up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KK) What if I want to make money while I sleep?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In year four, start outsourcing what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LL) How do I meet mentors and thought leaders?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have enough knowledge (after 100-200 books), write down 10 ideas for 20 different potential mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of them will respond. Write down 10 more ideas for 20 new mentors. Repeat every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put together a newsletter for everyone who doesn’t respond. Keep repeating until someone responds. Blog about your learning efforts. Build community around you being an expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MM) What if I can’t come up with ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then keep practicing coming up with ideas. The idea muscle atrophies. You have to build it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard for me to touch my toes if I haven’t been doing it every day. I have to do it every day for a while before I can easily touch my toes. Don’t expect to come up with good ideas on day one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NN) What else should I read?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AFTER books, read websites, forums, magazines. But most of that is garbage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OO) What if I do everything you say but it still doesn’t seem like it’s working?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will work. Just wait. Keep reinventing every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t try and find the end of the road. You can’t see it in the fog. But you can see the next step and you do know that if you take that next step eventually you get to the end of the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PP) What if I get depressed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sit in silence for one hour a day. You need to get back to your core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think this sounds stupid then don’t do it. Stay depressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QQ) What if I don’t have time to sit in silence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then sit in silence for two hours a day. This is not meditation. This is just sitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RR) What if I get scared?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep 8-9 hours a day and never gossip. Sleep is the No. 1 key to successful health. It’s not the only key. It’s just No. 1. Some people write to me and say, “I only need four hours of sleep” or “in my country sleeping means laziness.” Well, those people will fail and die young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about gossip? The brain biologically wants to have 150 friends. Then when you are with one of your friends you can gossip about any of the other 150. If you don’t have 150 friends then the brain wants to read gossip magazines until it thinks it has 150 friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be as stupid as your brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SS) What if I keep feeling like nothing ever works out for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend 10 minutes a day practicing gratitude. Don’t suppress the fear. Notice the anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also allow yourself to be grateful for the things you do have. Anger is never inspirational but gratitude is. Gratitude is the bridge between your world and the parallel universe where all creative ideas live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TT) What if I have to deal with personal bullshit all the time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find new people to be around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone who is reinventing herself will constantly find people to try and bring her down. The brain is scared of reinvention because it might not be safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biologically, the brain wants you to be safe and reinvention is a risk. So it will throw people in your path who will try to stop you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn how to say “no.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UU) What if I’m happy at my 9-t0-5 job?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine. Good luck. You are not one of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VV) Why should I trust you – you look like a failure to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do NOT trust me.  But be VERY VERY cynical of someone who portrays himself as a master with all of the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WW) Will you be my mentor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have just read this entire post.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Monk Thing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am just an OLD MONK, but after seeing friends and family again over Thanksgiving, I have been thinking a LOT about how I should TRAIN now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing is that my training not at all about me anymore, it’s mostly about what I should do so that I can more effectively work with others or assist others in THEIR training.  When an old monk survives long enough, he becomes more interested in next generation training (i.e. I want to train for the FUTURE threat, not my survival or the threat of yesterday or today). Some time ago, I started looking into training SYSTEMS … there are old school martial arts traditions, but there are plenty of worthy modern examples also such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.combatical.com/&quot;&gt;Marine Corps Martial Arts close combat training&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kravmaga-ikmf.com/krav-maga/train-in-israel/warriors-quest/&quot;&gt;Israeli Krav Maga training&lt;/a&gt;.  Since I respect traditions, I realize that I am not really any different from those who have come before me.  I am just an OLD MONK … but I am obligated to train others because I survived to be an old monk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some fairly simple and timeless rules that emerge …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;create-a-daily-practice-that-supports-and-sustains-you-and-advances-your-art&quot;&gt;Create a daily practice that supports and sustains you and advances your art.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Get up and get moving, move throughout the day. Try to eat better each day than you did the day before
2) Do the HARD THING that you fear most first so that your mind is clear to write, code, implement, debug
3) Play with principles and your original extension of principles rather than memorizing specific techniques, quotes, phrases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;rest-and-relax-without-engaging-in-bad-unmindful-habits&quot;&gt;Rest and relax without engaging in bad unmindful habits&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) If you need a distraction from your pathetic life, you’re doing it wrong.
2) Use or don’t use sex or stimulants or drugs or asceticism, but do not allow addiction to rule you.
3) Practice the habits of mindfulness, especially in your rest and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-essence-of-being-a-warrior-is-never-quitting-on-yourself&quot;&gt;The essence of being a warrior is never quitting on yourself.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Relapse is a necessary part of recovery, recovery is necessary to beat addiction. Don’t let relapse lead you back to addiction.
2) Celebrate your victories by working on your humility; never be satisfied – always think about the ways that you could have done something better or helped others more.
3) Be more anonymous, but rule by example. Avoid dick measuring competitions. Work harder at channeling desire for wealth, power, fame, sex, comfort into helping others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;you-can-be-dead-serious-without-losing-your-sense-of-humor&quot;&gt;You can be dead serious without losing your sense of humor.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Practice giving humor speeches or being a standup comic.
2) Have a point, but illustrate your point with humor, koans, riddles.
3) Shut up and listen.  Work on being a better listener.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Disrupting Education</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am still digesting the depth of what I learned at a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://chirontraining.com/Site/VioDy_MN_November.html&quot;&gt;Violence Dynamics seminar held in Mounds View, MN&lt;/a&gt; … the timetable of the material covered in this seminar is given at the bottom of this posting … but that doesn’t really describe the impact that the seminar had on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Marc MacYoung is responsible for pointing out that violence is a taboo topic nowadays in the same way that sex was a taboo topic in the 1950s.  You cannot talk about violence in polite company any more.  SEX is a completely different matter. Whether it’s stretched, holey spandex on an older overweight woman in Walmart OR the latest overexposure of something that one of the Kardashians should keep private OR a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2015/11/23/blogger-bread-vagina-yeast/#L4U6QKDgpaq3&quot;&gt;feminist using her own vaginal yeast for her sourdough bread&lt;/a&gt;, [whether you want to think about it or not] SEX is something that cannot and will not be underexpressed any more.  The sexual revolution is over and we all have lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Violence training can disrupt education in the same way that SEX has totally disrupted commerce.  When it comes to team building, trust networks and practical bonds between professionals NOTHING can match hands on training in violence.  When you put others into serious choke holds and, in turn, you are put into serious choke holds by every other person in class, you learn something about others that you cannot learn from a face-to-face conversation.  Serious means that a person has to tap out or loses consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Play and humor matter in anything – they are especially important in training and teambuilding. We need more class clowns; but those class clowns also need to handle being slapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Training should not end when the sessions wrap up.  Most of the commentary should occur AFTER the training session rather than during it.  By the same token there is something to be said for training prerequisites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) How should I train?  How should I work with others or lead others in training?  Since I am most interested in next generation training (i.e. I want to train for the FUTURE threat, not the threat of yesterday or today) I started looking into things like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kravmaga-ikmf.com/krav-maga/train-in-israel/warriors-quest/&quot;&gt;Israeli Krav Maga training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Go language and learning Russian</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking a lot about the old story or parable of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel&quot;&gt;Tower of Babel&lt;/a&gt; lately … parables embed wisdom in cultures.  The lesson from Tower of Babel is we should be nervous about imagining that we can work well in different languages on difficult safety-critical projects of any scale.  It is probably not humanly impossible for someone to become a proficiently-wise polyglot in just one lifetime; it is impossible to have a competent multi-lingual team.  There has to be a common language that glues the conversation and collaboration together.  Yes, it is possible to become fluent enough in multiple languages to become dangerous, but being proficient to be wise and think with clear judgement is a lot tougher … this is not exactly the same as saying that most authors will never develop the proficiency to be Shakespeare – that’s already obvious enough.  It’s sort of like saying that most authors will probably never develop the multi-lingual proficiency to become remotely as competent [in different languages/cultures] as Kurt Vonnegut or Norman Mailer or John le Carré were in English … and certainly no multi-lingual author will be as proficient in multiple languages as the Steinbecks, Hemingways, Faulkners or Clarkes, Asimovs, Heinleins and other proficient users of the English language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This posting is about computer languages, specifically the Go programming language.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=golang&amp;amp;date=3%2F2012%2073m&amp;amp;cmpt=q&amp;amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B5&quot;&gt;rate of adoption of Go language&lt;/a&gt; is just flat out impressive by almost any measure.  Go became a public open source project on November 10, 2009. After a couple of years of very active design and development, stability was called for and Go 1 was released on March 28, 2012.  There are, of course, other languages that one might want to be proficient or fluent in … languages that you cannot really ignore, even if you want to … C, Java, Python, Javascript, Erlang, Ruby, Haskell, Scala … but there are very good reasons to learn something about Go that are not just about why Go adoption is exploding, particularly in very interesting projects like Docker or CockroachDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to be VERY, VERY CAREFUL before you invest any effort learning in a new programming language … most programmers are not remotely careful enough about bumbling into a new language … if we want to understand why, let’s think about what we know about spoken languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-ways-to-learn-a-language-as-an-adult&quot;&gt;Learning any new language as an adult&lt;/a&gt; can be a rather daunting and unrewarding task AT FIRST.  4% of students embarking on &lt;em&gt;language courses in schools&lt;/em&gt; achieve a BASIC level of fluency after three years; 96% of the student invest time and money learning a language might start the best intentions and the kids are certainly smart enough and most of them are motivated enough to achieve other things in life, but they fail to learn new languages because they start out with completely wrong expectations. It takes 600+ hours of study and practice to reach BASIC fluency in a typical new language, unless you already speak a language that is linguistic similar, eg French-Spanish-Portuguese-Italian or English-German-Dutch are examples of linguistic similar languages … let that sink in for a second, 600+ is 2 hrs/day – ideally with most of that time spent practicing with fluent speaker, EVERY day for a full year to get a BASIC, three-year-old’s level of fluency!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluency is not proficiency or mastery, mind you … effectively, fluency is not that much more than being able to follow a conversation translating what the speaker says and to ask VERY, VERY BASIC questions – fluency means that you can interact, but it does not mean that you can interact natively, without thinking… fluency is like hacking code, copy-and-pasting algorithmic snippets and taking 5X or 10X as long to debug code as someoe who is good enough to be proficient … at some point, you need to move beyond simple hacking and translating and you need to form new thoughts and actually THINK in a language.  REALLY learning a lanaguage to be able to think in that language will take you a LOT MORE than just 600+ hours; probably at least one order if not almost two orders of magnitude longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the ENTIRE reason to go to the effort of really learning a language well enough to THINK in that language is that, as Ludwig Wittgenstein famously said long ago [Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1922)], &lt;em&gt;a new language will expand the limits of your world dramatically&lt;/em&gt; but only if you USE it* … you need to understand and live the idioms and patterns, the best practices and the stories and parables that go with them, the algorithms and ways of thinking. Learning new ways to think is the big reason to learn a new language and USE IT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will admit that these are not very robust metaphors but they do sort of illustrate the way that I see the language thing.  Being fluent in Javascript, Python, Ruby and various scripting languages is [for a native English speaker] a lot like learning German or learning to use English at a higher, more abstract level … everytime I turn around, I find myself thinking I should be better at these.  If I did not already have a bit of a background in it, C [and to some degree C++ and Java] would probably be like learning Chinese … almost painful, but I do not have a choice … the number of applications for it is in the billions and neither C nor Chinese are going to go away.  Learning other languages like Erlang, Haskell or Go are probably a lot like learning Russian – people are doing some really interesting, really complex things in those languages and the mental world inhabited by those people is obviously far different than the middle-class American mental realm … so why not explore it?  But there are limits to what I can do, so when it comes to other languages like Cobol, Pascal, Fortran or &lt;em&gt;even a scientific computing language like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia&quot;&gt;Julia&lt;/a&gt; that I probably SHOULD dig into&lt;/em&gt; … those languages are like French or Spanish or Portuguese or Italian … yes, I know that a lot of great people use them and maybe they really turned my head at one at one time, but I don’t see them impacting my future that directly so I think I will just rely on friends or robo translators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I will look at some Go idioms … or maybe some Russian proverbs&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>It looks like we might have CONSENSUS!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoy and am frustrated by the topic of CONSENSUS enough that I once started writing a book once about consensus and distributed leadership … &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.platosrepublicans.com/&quot;&gt;Plato’s Republicans&lt;/a&gt; … my interest in political economics and social choice theory gradually was overcome by the more concrete and practical world of consensus algorithms for distributed databases … although I continue to see BOTH topics as very closely related, but I now see that the implementations of the distributed database algorithms offers much more promise than the theoretic navel-gazing of political economics and the even more abstract topic of how leaders form, seize, shape, manipulate, define consensus … &lt;em&gt;if you thought consensus algorithms were difficult.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a techblog so my focus in this post is upon an exploration of consensus algorithms in distributed databases.  In these RT/FT algorithms as in life with humans, it is easy to recognize what consensus is after you are there … everyone loves it and we almost declare some sort of moral triumph when we exclaim, “So we have consensus!” … but the pain of converging on the final solution can be a bugger … especially if speed of convergence matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)&quot;&gt;Paxos&lt;/a&gt; … first published in 1989, named after a fictional legislative consensus system used on the Paxos island in Greece. The Paxos family of protocols includes a spectrum of trade-offs between the number of processors, number of message delays before learning the agreed value, the activity level of individual participants, number of messages sent, and types of failures. Although no deterministic fault-tolerant consensus protocol can guarantee progress in an asynchronous network, Paxos guarantees safety (consistency), and the conditions that could prevent it from making progress are difficult to provoke. Paxos is usually used where durability is required (for example, to replicate a file or a database), in which the amount of durable state could be large. The protocol attempts to make progress even during periods when some bounded number of replicas are unresponsive. There is also a mechanism to drop a permanently failed replica or to add a new replica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra%E2%80%93Toueg_consensus_algorithm&quot;&gt;Chandra-Toueg&lt;/a&gt; … published by Tushar Deepak Chandra and Sam Toueg in 1996, is an algorithm for solving consensus in a network of unreliable processes equipped with an eventually strong failure detector. The failure detector is an abstract version of timeouts; it signals to each process when other processes may have crashed. An eventually strong failure detector is one that never identifies some specific good process as having failed after some initial period of confusion, and at the same time eventually identifies all bad processes as failed. The algorithm itself is similar to the Paxos algorithm, which also relies on failure detectors. Both algorithms assume the number of faulty processes is less than n/2, where n is the total number of processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raft.github.io/&quot;&gt;Raft&lt;/a&gt; … first published in 2013 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ongardie.net/&quot;&gt;Diego Ongaro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/home.php&quot;&gt;John Osterhout&lt;/a&gt; is a understandable, more readily-implementable consensus algorithm designed as a more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ms705/pub/papers/2015-osr-raft.pdf&quot;&gt;practical alternative to famously difficult Paxos algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. It’s no accident – according to Ongaro, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bBggO6KN_k&quot;&gt;the idea for Raft was CONCIEVED and then DESIGNED AT EVERY STEP TO BE MORE UNDERSTANDABLE&lt;/a&gt; than Paxos or Chandra-Toueg algorithms by means of separation of logic, but it is also formally proven safe and offers some new features. Raft offers a generic way to distribute a state machine across a cluster of computing systems, ensuring that each node in the cluster agrees upon the same series of state transitions.  Although Raft is a recent development, it already has a number of open-source reference implementations, with full-spec implementations in Go, C++, Java, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/heidi-ann/ocaml-raft&quot;&gt;OCaml&lt;/a&gt; and Scala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.4765.pdf&quot;&gt;Ark&lt;/a&gt; … first published in 2014 by Zardosht Kashef and Leif Walsh It ultimately has many similarities with Raft, but diverges in a few ways, mainly to support other features like chained replication and unacknowledged writes (ie prevention from rolled back writes by elections). Ark elections have been used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Tokutek/mongo&quot;&gt;TokuMX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading list …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TBD accelerated social consensus research … &lt;em&gt;like the rest of this reading list, this is glaringly incomplete&lt;/em&gt; especially given the material that should be out there on NEW forms of social leadership … what does social graph research tell us about the emergence of leader candidates; can the heuristic selection of leaders be applied to algorithms?  One would think that surely the voluminous research afforded by all of the social graph data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04227&quot;&gt;Twitter latent communities&lt;/a&gt; or others like FB or LinkedIn have taught us at least as much about nuances in the selection of Leaders and how followers aggregate as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance&quot;&gt;Byzantine Generals&lt;/a&gt; ever taught us about fault-tolerance, right… consider also Bitcoin and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect&quot;&gt;other cultural phenomena, such as the bandwagon effect&lt;/a&gt; … as one might expect in industries where social interaction threatens the dominant regime, there are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC411092/&quot;&gt;really thorough, CRITICAL systematic reviews of the effects of online peer to peer interactions in healthcare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TBD consensus algorithm dissertations and peer-reviewed papers … another glaringly incomplete bullet point … &lt;a href=&quot;http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~blackbal/Thesis/thesis.pdf&quot;&gt;A Formal Approach to Fault Tolerant Distributed Consensus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://research.google.com/archive/spanner.html&quot;&gt;Google’s Spanner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.google.com/archive/spanner-osdi2012.pptx&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://livestream.com/accounts/1545775/osdi12/videos/4646642&quot;&gt;2012 talk at OSDI&lt;/a&gt; Spanner is Google’s scalable, multi-version, globally-distributed, and synchronously-replicated database. It is the first system to distribute data at global scale and support externally-consistent distributed transactions. This paper describes how Spanner is structured, its feature set, the rationale underlying various design decisions, and a novel time API that exposes clock uncertainty. This API and its implementation are critical to supporting external consistency and a variety of powerful features: non-blocking reads in the past, lock-free read-only transactions, and atomic schema changes, across all of Spanner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/articles/balancing-strong-and-eventual-consistency-with-google-cloud-datastore/&quot;&gt;Google Cloud Datastore balances strong and eventual consistency&lt;/a&gt; … achieving strong consistency for a positive user experience while leveraging the eventual consistency model to scale to large datasets. Eventual consistency is a theoretical guarantee that, provided no new updates to an entity are made, all reads of the entity will eventually return the last updated value. The Internet Domain Name System (DNS) is a well-known example of a system with an eventual consistency model. DNS servers do not necessarily reflect the latest values but, rather, the values are cached and replicated across many directories over the Internet. It takes a certain amount of time to replicate modified values to all DNS clients and servers. However, the DNS system is a very successful system that has become one of the foundations of the Internet. It is highly available and has proven to be extremely scalable, enabling name lookups to over a hundred million devices across the entire Internet.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency&quot;&gt;Eventually consistent&lt;/a&gt; services are often classified as providing BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) semantics, in contrast to traditional ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees. Eventual consistency is sometimes criticized as increasing the complexity of distributed software applications. This is partly because eventual consistency is purely a liveness guarantee (reads eventually return the same value) and does not make safety guarantees: an eventually consistent system can return any value before it converges.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/articles/cap-twelve-years-later-how-the-rules-have-changed&quot;&gt;The CAP theorem&lt;/a&gt; asserts that any net­worked shared-data system can have only two of three desirable properties. How­ever, by explicitly handling partitions, designers can optimize consistency and availability, thereby achieving some trade-off of all three.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The best way to criticize is to create!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best way to criticize is to CREATE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an abstract sense, we all [should] want to fight evil. It is necessary to avoid aiding evil by just generating more chaos, but you can always recognize evil by its actions; evil terrorizes and oppresses and blames while using all kinds of arguments and pride to justify its use of terror, blame and jealousy.  If you want to defeat an enemy, Sun Tzu’s advice will always hold “first attack the enemy’s strategy, then his alliance, next his army and last his cities.” In other words, &lt;strong&gt;attack the PROBLEM intelligently and creatively, don’t be an idiot and harm the innocents!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is tough to think strategically about fighting something as abstract as evil, but you can bring it down to the intensely practical level, where evil has directly impacted your own daily life.  You do not need to look all that far to find the presence of evil … you know what you need to do in your own life or your own projects, for example … be persistent, aim for quality not quantity, be more fit, train and exercise your muscle and your mind, humbly never stop learning and maniacally research your customer … fighting evil is basically a matter of working hard doing the right things before you get paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You already know what evil is when you see it; you shouldn’t switch on the news or get distracted by the movies. You are swimming in evil all around you. You might have witnessed the effects of different forms of evil: telling lies, gossiping, cheating, underhanded subterfuges, engaging in office politics, for instance.  You don’t want to attack the cities of innocent people; you want to attack strategically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically, this means finding a PROBLEM that bugs you and attacking the problem, not the people.  You might want to fight the strategies of obfuscators and weasels OR if you detest toxic workplaces and resource-wasting meetings, you have to work on a strategy that involves creating a more just equitable, honest, open workflow.  It’s one thing to do that on your own, but establishing something like for others has been really HARD to accomplish on your own … until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2015/03/github-conquered-google-microsoft-everyone-else/&quot;&gt;the open source revolution has FULLY arrived and now legitimately dominates economic growth in the world&lt;/a&gt;, you can and should become an OpenSourcist, join forces with others in something like playing a small role &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/community&quot;&gt;the Git community&lt;/a&gt; to create an even better Git or curate a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLElrASo3VHBy9JJzDdkvkqdV0ZlbCCheR&quot;&gt;playlist of useful Git-related videos&lt;/a&gt; or even just convincing others to use a distributed version controls system like Git in a blog posting.  The [Git Documentation repository &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/Documentation&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/git/git&quot;&gt;Git source code repository&lt;/a&gt; has several files of interest to developers who are looking to help contribute. After reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/CodingGuidelines&quot;&gt;coding guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, you can learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches&quot;&gt;how to submit patches&lt;/a&gt;. For those looking to get more deeply involved, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/howto/maintain-git.txt&quot;&gt;howto for Git maintainers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is also important to not to be too trusting and maintain a situational awareness for what is happening in the open source world – as these projects become significantly larger and much more valuable, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2015/07/open-source-going-even-openbecause/&quot;&gt;open source single-sponsor model breaks down&lt;/a&gt;.  There’s a still a lot of proprietary, closed-source evil to fight … there are TONS of allies and they are hard-nosed practical fighters not altuistic idealist pansies … so if you want to be an Open Source warrior, you need to “march toward the sound of gunfire” or find the most awesome startup companies or heavily-starred, heavily-followed ACTIVE repositories, roll up your sleeves and fork and clone different repositories, learn everything you can about the code, learn about the people and the organizations that are involved, blog/tweet/evangelize about what they are up to … network with different people doing cool things, help do cool things and then network some more!  Don’t stop fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to defeat evil, work at creating a PRODUCTIVE community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best way to fight is to create.  There are opportunities everywhere.  ATTACK the problems! ATTACK the opportunities! ATTACK! The best way to attack is to create!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Workflow-As-Code ... getting the culture to drive freedom and responsibility</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/03/13/culture-why-its-the-hottest-topic-in-business-today/&quot;&gt;Culture&lt;/a&gt; should be an important topic because organizational culture drives organization output.  How can we enable the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664&quot;&gt;most healthy, most enjoyable, MOST PRODUCTIVE customer-centric culture&lt;/a&gt; … and after we do that, how do we make it even BETTER?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practical experience of the most successful emergent up-and-coming firms on the planet right now, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://techblog.netflix.com/&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/2fBNuK6CRmA?t=54m46s&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or Airbnb or Uber or any emergent company you want to pick, suggest that a better, more dynamic and antifragile culture is NOT a matter of diversity quotas or cool perks or quirky policy or any nice little participation ribbon tied to some secondary or tertiary initiative that was allowed to pollute the work environment … the most important thing about a better culture is customer-driven focus … that means that everyone must respect and serve the central mission of the organization with an expectation of performance and delivery on SMART objectives that are aligned to the customer-driven focus … a better culture comes with the freedom and responsibility to build personal and professional independence and to be able to move on to something that serves customers even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is about lean thinking, seeing waste and designing the non-value-added distractions out of the equation and optimizing the flow past the constraints in our systems and our workflow.   A better FLOW of work that has become practically achievable by understanding that all knowledge work is a matter of programming and the opportunity to automate a better workflow with extensible software systems – there are lessons from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2&quot;&gt;professional use of Git distributed version-control database technology&lt;/a&gt; and the development of extensible, open source software that apply to EVERY business with a future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Git story is one that particularly worth understanding.  Git software didn’t exist just a little 10 years ago; it was created for the Linux kernel, but Git’s impact will probably be larger than Linux – because of how Git provides for distributed, decentralized team workflows for geographically-dispersed teams.  Although Git might have emerged from a particular software development need, it is very important to understand that the uses for Git are not just about software … Git will change the workflow of ANYONE doing ANY kind knowledge work [if it hasn’t already].  Beyond just geography or physical barriers, why couldn’t a a technology like Git [and Git host like Github, tools like Gitter] by changing the workplace and workflows help diversify workflows and really change things like the fact that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.os4w.org/&quot;&gt;only one in ten open source contributors are women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;?  &lt;em&gt;Why do we need to tolerate cultures that perpetuate that kind of problem any more?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by thinking about how a Git workflow radically changes or completely ELIMINATES meetings it is important to think about what that means for a culture of more diverse, geographically-distributed professionals who WERE unable for good reasons (eg, childcare, care of an elderly parent) to participate in meetings before.  If we think about that long enough, we start realizing deeper reasons for WHY the meetings are now unnecessary [except for the comfort of dinosaurs].  Git-centric conversations about writing/editing/issues in using code/content in repositories gravitate toward a continually transcripted chat-driven 24x7 conversation which does not need to interrupt the other work and mental focus of participants.  The technology of these Git chats includes handy and extensible repository-centric chat tools like Gitter for keeping everyone in the conversation focused on the same issue.  Moreover, the urls for each conversation node in the transcript eliminate the annoying “He said/She said” games that get played with flawed recollections of verbal meetings.  For chats and reasons related to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/categories/graphs-and-contributions/&quot;&gt;codegraphs of contributions and other activity&lt;/a&gt;, Git is also changing the way that professionals and professional teams are managed [because everyone can see who is doing what when; team structures get a lot flatter and there’s less room for politics or &lt;em&gt;weasel&lt;/em&gt;] … beyond that, a Git portfolio or GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile-page/&quot;&gt;professional profile&lt;/a&gt; also changes the way those professionals develop their resumes and &lt;em&gt;advertise&lt;/em&gt; their body of or work or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/categories/commits/&quot;&gt;commits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to repositories which represent their collaborative work history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github [the largest host of Git repositories] provides for a common, standardized, hyper-efficient Git workflow … the Github workflow is so efficient because it applies seamlessly as developers or authors switch to OTHER open source projects and other teams that are using GitHub … Github has had a GIGANTIC impact on software development in the last five years and this impact is expanding … all kinds of knowledge workers who write books or develop any kind of content collaboratively are moving to Git and Github  … it is worth reading the account of Github’s rise on Wired magazine to understand the larger significance of what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/tag/github/&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Git all authors participating in a project have version-controlled copies of the entire project repository [or repositories] on their own local machines.  Git manages the edits/revisions while providing full tracking of exactly who did what to the code or text document … Git also retains all branches or forks – ALL of the creation/edit/revision/merge history is there, so there don’t have to be any worries about deletions or unwanted changes.  This allows for COMFORTABLY adopting a radically decentralized, distributed workflow for dispersed teams as well as meshing people with unconventional schedules (eg nightowls collaborating with early-risers and normal people with 9-to-5 jobs who code after hours).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to reiterate that Github is ONLY one host of open source Git databases … there are other hosts, but there are very solid reasons why Github has rapidly become the largest host using the Git software, not all of those reasons are in the Wired article – one BIG reason is GitHub’s CIO Scott Chacon, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/ZDR433b0HJY&quot;&gt;how incredibly deep Chacon’s knowledge of Git was&lt;/a&gt; years before anyone else’s AND how hard Chacon is now driving Github now to increase the depth of its knowledge of Git even further by looking at how GitHub users break the system with edge cases, boundary conditions, runaway code and all sorts of unique issues that pop up on the radar screen of a host with Github’s scale … it’s not just that Github is getting better at hosting Git; Git is getting better, too.  The Git software that is used for these databases is itself an open source project and there are plenty of other Git hosts who can step in if Github falters or changes. It is also important to understand WHY the Git open source software is not standing still.  The scale of Github and its involvement in the open source Git project are driving Git to improve and “grind the rough edges off” – the immense scale and scope in the usage profile is pushing Git to mature into a SIMPLER software package!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about Git, the best resource is Chacon’s book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/progit/progit2&quot;&gt;ProGit2&lt;/a&gt; … it’s available as a free download for Kindle (mobi) or Apple iBooks (epub) or PDF or HTML5 or … the full source of ProGit2 [prior to publishing] is available as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/progit/progit2&quot;&gt;the ProGit2 GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; if anyone wants to write a better book or one more well-tailored to their particular needs.  The GitHub guys really “eat their own dog food” when it comes to their fanatical belief in open source and transforming workflows with Git … and their philosophical freeopensourcedness of “giving it all away” has probably caused a lot journos, experts and other dinosaurs to dismiss how big of a deal GitHub is …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very important to understand that Github and Git are not just about software … those technologies apply to all kinds of knowledge work AND they are extensible, open source technologies that will continue to get better if we master them and make them better.  We need to understand that stupid, unproductive cultures are not just about failing to recognize people’s contributions or somehow hurting the feelings of productive people.  The backward cultures that we now settle for are not just about failing to be kind [although that is bad enough], those cultures are costing us because they are about failing to accelerated the development of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664&quot;&gt;MORE healthy, MORE enjoyable, MORE PRODUCTIVE, MORE customer-centric cultures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
