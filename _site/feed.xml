        <title>Is Kubernetes the new Linux?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Given what Linux has been for the last 25 years, this would be a mighty big claim. Does it have any merit? Some pretty smart people think so … but then again, one should ALWAYS doubt the experts. Except that these experts are not just evangelists or tech journos or pundits or people who are trying to make names for themselves on the tech conf circuit by making a splash with outlandish &lt;em&gt;visionary&lt;/em&gt; claims … they are the engineers who actually the architect and engineers leading the projects that are delivering big results, ie largely anonymous tech nobobies that we actually count on every moment of our digital lives even though we don’t realize exactly what we’re counting on and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent Open Source Summit of September 2017,&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/llunved&quot;&gt;Daniel Riek&lt;/a&gt;, Sr. Directory Systems Design &amp;amp; Engineering for Red Hat and leader on Red Hat’s container technology strategy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.projectatomic.io/&quot;&gt;Project Atomic&lt;/a&gt;, stated that containers and &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; are having a deep impact on the Linux operating system (OS) that goes well beyond just DevOps and and just cloud-native applications. The concepts of application-centric packaging, process isolation through Linux containers, and immutable infrastructure are shaking up the core traditions of today’s GNU/Linux operating systems. These concepts are also challenging the assumptions and approaches derived from the past 40+ years of work that originated with UNIX. The Linux distribution as we know it is coming to an end, and is being replaced by a new concept of containerized, multi-instance, multi-user applications, which can be deployed in scale-out environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, software stacks have gotten to be too complex to be mapped onto a common monolithic namespace, so Kubernetes is effectively the new Linux … which would mean that we should not be surprised by the enormous amount of development activity swarming around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes&quot;&gt;Kubernetes repositories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>It time to really get after it on Git</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It WAS time to really get after it on Git a decade ago, now it REALLY is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git keeps surpassing expectations and changing how creative people collaborate.  Git is an EVEN bigger deal than Linus Torvalds imagined when it would be when he first developed Git … bigger than the founders of Github imagined it would ever be when they founded Github … bigger than pundits imagined when they reported on how almost all software developers were moving to Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-is-not-just-for-code-git-is-distributed-version-control-for-all-collaborative-creative-content&quot;&gt;Git is not just for code, Git is distributed version control for ALL collaborative creative content&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git does not care whether it is being used for managing human-readable code or managing large binaries, its support for large files means that it does not discriminate between types of files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-is-secure-not-perfectly-secure-but-probably-secure-enough&quot;&gt;Git is secure, not perfectly secure but probably secure enough&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHA 1 and paying close attention to Git logs is not absolutely perfect, but it’s pretty damned good. The Git community is making Git more secure. Most importantly, it is important to use good practices and tools are available … no system of security is perfectly secure; even the best system of security is worthless if people do not actually use the tools and best practices that are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-is-not-just-for-managing-collaboration-its-for-optimizing-collaboration&quot;&gt;Git is not just for managing collaboration, it’s for optimizing collaboration&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as one looks on the horizon, there’s no end to the better and better tools for better visibility into the details of collaboration, better optimization and tracking of code reviews, better code quality and all kinds of different metrics of effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;capable-mature-managed-and-optimized-professional-git&quot;&gt;Capable, mature, managed and optimized professional Git&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About half … maybe it’s still slightly less, maybe it’s slightly more … of the professional software development being done now uses Git. The adoption of Git is growing so it some might argue that the percentage is higher, but many still use Git because they have to, not because they understand why they really NEED to. Therefore, the biggest difficulty in using Git is cultural just as the biggest difficulty in writing well is not the problem with word processing tools but with use of the words and idioms in the language.  Thus, the main problem with Git is not a really technological problem or lack of features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When everyone is more or less on the page Git-wise, Git immensely simplifies and improves the software development cycle, not just in enabling users to create, use, and switch between versions easily, but also to provide metrics and quantitatively improve processes. That is why it is so essential for a creative professional to really understand the basic Git model and overall Git workflow. That means developing a familiarity with the Git management concepts and commands to avoid the trip-ups and missteps that put off people from really using Git to track changes and work with branches in teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fully leveraging Git’s full functionality means going beyond integrating Git in the workflow used by developers in popular software development toolchains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-hasnt-mastering-git-been-one-of-the-priorities-of-anyone-involved-in-the-creation-of-creative-content&quot;&gt;WHY hasn’t mastering Git been one of the priorities of anyone involved in the creation of creative content?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good question. As another person who’s behind the curve on Git, I have absolutely NO good answer on that one … it happens. It is like the answer for why I don’t get up at 4:30 every single morning to do calisthenics to build my fitness and self-discipline. I dunno why I don’t do it. I should. I know that I should. But I haven’t. I just know that I should and need to. I cannot fix or redo the last decade, year, month or days – I can only fix today and work on it again tomorrow. I cannot fix or help other people, I can only work on myself and my example might matter to some but it won’t matter to most. But consistency matters going forward matters so much. It is important to just stay at it.&lt;/p&gt;
