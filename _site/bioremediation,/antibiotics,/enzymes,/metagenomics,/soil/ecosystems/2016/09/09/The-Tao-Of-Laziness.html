    <p><em>First they came for the irredeemable, deplorable lunatics, and I did not speak out — Because I didn’t think I was a irredeemable, deplorable lunatic.</em></p>

<p><em>Then they came for the guys who post YouTube videos, and I did not speak out — Because I don’t know how to shoot videos or post to YouTube.</em></p>

<p><em>Then they came for the <a href="http://twitchy.com/dougp-3137/2016/09/12/what-a-scream-howard-dean-has-had-it-with-anti-hillary-bias-from-npr/">NPR</a>, and I did not speak out — Because I don’t listen to public radio.</em></p>

<p><em>Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.</em></p>

<p>This is an explanation of why I think we should just let things rot .. because rotting is part of the chemical, nutrient and life cycle of human existence … although there could be giant benefits to subtly manipulating, ie ACCELERATING, the rotting process.</p>

<p>The complexity of soil ecosystems has some important lessons for how we think about human interactions and optimizing those interactions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, human beings really know remarkably little about soil ecosystems … there are people who know a lot … but generally speaking, the population of farmers in the world knows a LOT more about government programs than they know about soil fungi, bacteria, earthworms and plant roots interactions … because IT PAYS to study farm programs – there’s not really any serious money in building soil … so when MOST farmers are bouncing around in their tractor seats, a lot of them might be worried about farm programs, revenue assurance policies, making sure that they’ve dotted the i’s and crossed the t’s so that they are still eligible for maximized federally-subsidized guaranteed income streams to finance the purchase of more equipment or farmland … but MOST of them are NOT thinking about optimizing the soil ecosystems under their control – some are, but MOST are thinking more about farm programs because farm programs drive incentives and influence the mindshare of what sharp, capable, hard-working people think about.</p>

<p>So if you are one of those who still imagines that governments and bureaucratic silos are NOT the problem … please correct your thinking … when it comes to agriculture, food and soil science, government is most definitely THE PROBLEM … or, more correctly, it creates and feeds the problem of ultra-risk averse welfare maximization [rather than scarce amounts of ambition, creativity and investment devoted to new product creation and value addition in the economy] coupled with political rent-seeking by industry organizations paid for by dues / checkoffs / contributions from welfare recipients that defend and expand welfare payments and subsidies to people who are already quite wealthy.</p>

<p>There’s a 3000-yr-old chinese proverb that applies to the the debacle created by the USDA and various farm programs … as well as the Affordable Care Act, or Dodd-Frank or any other monsterous debacle created by clueless morons trying to give the appearance that they want to help … <strong>A government has a strategy … as result of that, the people will need to find counter strategies.</strong></p>

<p><em>DON’T help!</em></p>

<p>Mostly, we should think about what is really valuable, about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLElrASo3VHBxt9zg3oRoKSqmyiCHct4Ai">what really matters</a>.  The purpose of everything we do … programming, writing, experimenting, trying things … is INSIGHT. It’s not getting a candidate elected OR convincing someone to believe a LIE OR jealously manipulating and obfuscating truth so that our dick looks bigger in the giant dick-measuring contest that we think everyone wants to be part of. The indisputable truth is still there …  <strong>Every politician, every government has a [worse than just WORTHLESS] strategy, which will create more problems that it fixes. The people have work harder at finding counter strategies that give them the insight to actually make their lives better.</strong>  The world doesn’t really need calories or protein or energy or all kinds of free shit – people can and will figure that stuff out in the best manner on their own … the clarity of NO SOLUTION is actually helpful.  We should think a lot more about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLElrASo3VHBxt9zg3oRoKSqmyiCHct4Ai">what really matters</a> in terms of helping people to find INSIGHT.</p>

<p><em>Insight is always in short supply.</em>  Insight is impossible to find in a bureaucratic silo.</p>

<p>Let’s go back to the world of agriculture and soil building. If you look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1BpauXRp6U">what is emerging down at the suburban street level in the world of permaculture</a>, you have to be excited about the ‘counter strategies’ that PEOPLE are developing … without or in spite of government interference.  The largest danger that these independent efforts faces is the subtle subversion executed by government officials … as the officials attempt to co-opt and direct the movement by <em>teaching birds to fly</em> with criticisms, i.e. “<em>You doing it wrong, haven’t you read paragraph 4(b) of chapter 357.19 in the code. Here’s a pamphlet on how gardeners can comply with the code.</em>” or <em>offering</em> their policies, programs and incentives to <em>participate</em> in their government-controlled bureaucratic silo.</p>

<p>Government-controlled bureaucratic silos steadily atrophy skills and disenfranchise people by subtly inducing independent people believe they need to follow the MASTER, to not just accept assistance from the MASTER, but get comfortable with and begin to depend upon the subsidized revenue insurance, leadership and direction from the MASTER … while the MASTER places the radio-controlled shock collar and tracking device around your neck, and maybe embeds a carefully selected mix of stories in your social media feeds so that even the thoughts that are imagined to be spontaneous are actually the result of subconscious programming.</p>

<p>The cocksuckers are incredibly seductive and powerful … so powerful that there is a COLD civil war that is now underway in which the cocksuckers are persecuting, taxing and regulating the inventors, creators, entrepreneurs and other productive people into oblivion … this COLD civil war will eventually become a HOT civil war … maybe not immediately, in the next year or decade, but eventually the COLD civil war will turn HOT.</p>

<p>People who imagine that overthrow of the government is impossible because the government holds all the resources do not understand the nature of fighting and using a stronger, but unjust opponent’s strengths and weapons against him. The bureaucratic centralizers of the Union are still in the process of devising and implementing the schlerotic regime that will choke initiative and diversity to product a demoralizing defeat and complete, incomprehensible capitulation for them. Shutting down NEW growth always preceded death and rot of living systems. Death is part of life; decay and rot pave the way for the next generation of life.</p>

<p>Don’t rush the schlerosis … if it needs another century, fine … give it time, whether it was McClelland fighting Lee in the 19th century or folks like McNamara and Westmoreland fighting Giáp in the 20th, the game still works the same … ultimately, any insurgency with a just cause … even if it’s like Lee/Jackson v McClelland with a perceived just cause of the Union being in Virginia … the supposedly weaker opponent ALWAYS annihilates an enemy with more and better systems, resources, arms, personnel … if Lee hadn’t gone into Pennsylvania in 1863, the South could have lasted a very long time, someone would have stepped up to take Jackson’s place. The South was ultimately going to lose because its cause, ie perpetuation of slavery, was thoroughly and deeply unjust … the Union would have found ways to incompetently continue to provide the CSA with “free” resources and materials; the Union did not win as much as South LOST the First Civil War because its unjust cause eventually dried up its talent and any hope of foreign assistance.</p>

<p>It’s not really different now … it is only a matter of time before the power centralizers LOSE to those wishing for distributed and decentralized freedom and lose … the authoritarians will lose in a completely convincing and obvious fashion … the just cause can always tolerate incredibly high casualties because anything perceived as a just and righteous cause is ALWAYS going to be an unstoppable recruiting tool to bring in new allies. Consider the case of Al Qaeda and ISIS … the PERCEPTION of their cause being just [in certain populations] means that defeating them will be next to impossible, regardless of the resources deployed … the ONLY way to defeat them is by correcting the perception that their cause is just. Frankly, it will be IMPOSSIBLE to do that as long as we don’t do a better job of providing a better alternative, with an economy and culture that encourages a higher rate of new business formation and ventures that create new opportunities for billions of young people wanting to do something meaningful with their lives.</p>

<p>As long as the top-down centralizers and powerful cronies are in control and stifling bottom-up entrepreneurial freedom, the West’s cause will be equally as unjust as Al Qaeda’s or ISIS’s … it will only be a different flavor of injustice.</p>
