  <article class="post-content">
    <p>It is said that travel helps one to find new perspectives, prospect for new interests, meet new friends … and although I believe that could not be more true, I also believe that traveling for the sake of traveling, or crossing places visited off some sort of bucket list, is mostly a non-value-added activity that involves shipping a live body around the planet. Of course, we all know that there ARE interactions and experiences that you simply cannot have in a virtual realm, but the fact of the matter is that information, communication and VR technologies are raising the level of what can be experienced virtually, while the expenses, difficulties and uncertainties of travel are basically unchanged. When the relative costs change, it is necessary to reallocate resources … and this applies just as much to the area of knowledge prospecting.</p>

<p>For SOME, this means that they can accomplish more in less time … affording MORE time for travel – but for people like me, it means that I can accomplish more [knowledge prospecting] in less time AND because of that I can engage in more pure knowledge prospecting, [scientific] content consumption, data analysis AND I can <strong>do more walking, biking, and GARDENING outdoors</strong> rather than being cooped up in car, plane or hotel room. In essence, writing code, analyzing data and working remotely, as well as being more engaged in more relationships FROM A DISTANCE allows me to spend more time time getting dirt under my fingernails as I have more time for serious investigation of soil ecosystems and using/developing laboratory tools things like the <a href="https://nanoporetech.com/applications/metagenomics">GWAS metagenomics and nanopore DNA sequencing technology</a> in the field.</p>

<p>In order for me to do this, it is still very much necessary for me to travel in a virtual sense … to learn new skills for communication with others … and, beyond that, to extend and develop new tools for traveling even further … because the revolution in the ability to prospect for knowledge in a virtual fashion is only just beginning … it will change as more and more people adapt and the network effects create new opportunities … in the same way, that personal computers … then client-server networked computers … and the internet and world wide web … and social media, mobile and wireless technologies have changed how people prospect for information and begin to travel virtually.</p>

<p>It’s no different than fire or boats or the wheel or sharp tools or hard metals …  it will be always be necessary for humans to pick up knowledge … in order to develop and extend new tools that make it possible to explore new realms of knowledge.</p>
