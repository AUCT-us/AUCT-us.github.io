  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Here’s a starter list … read it over, agree/disagree, change it, improve it, reinvent your own list for reinventing yourself.  This one is mine [in its current revision]; I <em>plageurized, cheated, stole</em> and reinvented it after reading and re-reading <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2013/12/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-reinventing-yourself-2/">James Altucher’s THE ULTIMATE CHEAT SHEET FOR REINVENTING YOURSELF</a>.</p>

<p>A) Learn to <em>plageurize, cheat, steal</em> but make the REINVENTION your OWN.</p>

<p>OWN your life. Put that life together with the free stuff that you find laying around, but do not just accumulate a pile of junk.  Shaping the stuff that you have laying around into your reinvented future takes ingenuity, vision and EFFORT.  Fixing and polishing your reinvented life is not easy before it is a success; get used to being second-guessed and disrepected.</p>

<p>B) Worry about NOW. 5S your life. Focus on your health, your breathing, your diet, the small details.  Fall in love with the person you are becoming.</p>

<p>Start by moving the needle on your level of fitness and productivity, so that you have more time and energy to tackle other areas.</p>

<p>Take baby steps, but program yourself each day to have better habits.</p>

<p>C) Reinvention never stops … start today, but realize that you cannot reinvent yourself in a month or a year, you need to work a five-year plan.</p>

<p>It’a all about the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. Every day, every week, every month, every year you need to invest a small amount of time in checking your progress doing what you’ve planned, taking action to bring your performance in line with the plan, then re-calibrating the plan and doing it again.</p>

<p>Here’s a description of what you might expect in the five year plan:</p>

<p>Year One: you are flailing, drinking from the firehose, reading and absorbing everything, you are learning fast, but you’re a like baby … life is tough.
Year Two: you are still “selling snake oil” but know who you need to talk to and network with, i.e. you understand the movers, dice, cards and board layout of your new game.
Year Three: your plan is good enough to start making some money, but it isn’t anything to brag about and probably is not a living yet.
Year Four: your plan is providing an okayish living
Year Five: your plan is starting to compound and give you indications that it might generate real wealth</p>

<p>If it works better, faster than that, great … but don’t expect and prepare yourself mentally for it to be worse.</p>

<p>D) Give everything away; ditch your baggage.</p>

<p>If you wanna be more effing tough, you need to develop the SKILLS to be able to continually start from scratch.</p>

<p>Screw pride! Waste your time in dick measuring contests and your core competency is LOSING dick measuring contests. #TheresAlwaysABiggerDick</p>

<p>E) You need a mentor of some sort another.  You also need to mentor others.</p>

<p>There are all kinds of mentors; here are three archetypes … there are more.</p>

<p>1) Respected master. Be EXTREMELY CAREFUL. Do NOT join a cult. Certainly do no seek to be a cult leader … be careful when others follow you.
2) Indirect. Books, podcasts, vlogs, blogs, social media
3) Ordinary “average joe.””  Everyone has unique skill, knowledge about something. Every person could be your mentor.</p>

<p>F) Program yourself to not be passive and programmed, be more skeptical, ask more questions.</p>

<p>THINK! Become a listening leader – seek out people who are DIFFERENT than you.</p>

<p>G) Be more humble. You are not humble enough right now, you will be humiliated. Get used to it.</p>

<p>If you think you can reinvent yourself easier, faster, better or without giving up everything – then you too damned arrogant, too full of pride, not really ready, willing or able to change.</p>

<p>Do NOT succumb to your own PR and start imagining that you walk on water.</p>

<p>H) It’s not about the money … well, okay to some degree it is.</p>

<p>When people say “it’s not about the money” they should make sure they have a different measuring stick; money is not a bad measuring stick to start with, but you need a better WHY than just money.</p>

<p>“What about just doing what you love?” There will be many days when you don’t love what you are doing. If you are doing it just for love then it will take much much longer than five years.</p>

<p>Happiness is just a positive perception from our brain. Some days you will be unhappy. Our brain is a tool we use. It’s not who we are.</p>

<p>I) When can you say, “I do X!” where X is your new career or your new enterprise?</p>

<p>Today.</p>

<p>J) When can I start doing X?</p>

<p>Today.</p>

<p>Read … listen to mentors, but don’t waste all day reading.
Write … dream, but don’t spend all day dreaming … write down your dreams and start sketching out a plan.
Plan-Do-Check-Act … start spec-ing out the idea for your business/life. Get going today. Get up tomorrow and do it again.</p>

<p>K) How will this business or new life of mine ever make money?</p>

<p>At first, it won’t you will have to scramble for a couple years, working at other jobs or somehow scraping together the money to live on and begin starting your business.  Starting a business necessarily involves doing OTHER things … full-time … stop believing that you are entitled to be carried while you start your business … you don’t get to watch televison or relax anymore if you want to do this.</p>

<p>In the first “alpha” year, you must reconceive your customer – to do this you have to work doing the research to develop a competitive situational awareness in your niche to understand what you will need to do to be one of the best 200-300 people in the world.</p>

<p>In the second “beta” year, you will work hard at doing what you need to do to launch your prototype product or service and then correcting the flaws so that you move beyond the “beta” level to begin getting solid paying customers and building your business.</p>

<p>By year three you’ve put in 5,000-7,000 hours and you launch the real deal … something that is good enough to be in the top 200-300 in the world in anything. The top 200 in almost any field makes a living.</p>

<p>By year four you will scale that up and polish to take out the non-value-added distractions to allow you to make a decent, comfortable living. Some people stop at year four.</p>

<p>By year five you’re in the top 30-50 so you can actually invest in compounding your succcess to make genuine wealth.</p>

<p>M) What is “it”? How do I know what I should do?</p>

<p>Whatever area you feel like reading 500 books about. Go to the bookstore and find it. If you get bored three months later go back to the bookstore.</p>

<p>It’s okay to get disillusioned. That’s what failure is about. Success is better than failure but the biggest lessons are found in failure.</p>

<p>Very important: There’s no rush. You will reinvent yourself many times in an interesting life. You will fail to reinvent many times. That’s fun also.</p>

<p>Many reinventions make your life a book of stories instead of a textbook.</p>

<p>Some people want the story of their life to be a textbook. For better or worse, mine is a book of stories.</p>

<p>That’s why reinvention happens every day.</p>

<p>N) The choices you make today will be in your biography tomorrow.</p>

<p>Make interesting choices and you will have an interesting biography.</p>

<p>N1) The choices you make today will be in your biology tomorrow.</p>

<p>O) What if I like something obscure? Like biblical archaeology or 11th-century warfare?</p>

<p>Repeat all of the steps above, and then in year five you will make wealth. We have no idea how. Don’t look to find the end of the road when you are still at the very first step.</p>

<p>fall</p>

<p>P) What if my family wants me to be an accountant?</p>

<p>How many years of your life did you promise your family? Ten years? Your whole life? Then wait until the next life. The good thing is: you get to choose.</p>

<p>Choose freedom over family. Freedom over preconceptions. Freedom over government. Freedom over people-pleasing. Then you will be pleased.</p>

<p>Q) My mentor wants me to do it HIS way.</p>

<p>That’s fine. Learn HIS way. Then do it YOUR way. With respect.</p>

<p>Hopefully nobody has a gun to your head. Then you have to do it their way until the gun is put down.</p>

<p>R) My spouse is worried about who will support/take care of kids?</p>

<p>Then after you work 16 hours a day, seven days a week being a janitor, use your spare time to reinvent.</p>

<p>Someone who is reinventing ALWAYS has spare time. Part of reinvention is collecting little bits and pieces of time and re-carving them the way you want them to be.</p>

<p>S) What if my friends think I’m crazy?</p>

<p>What friends?</p>

<p>T) What if I want to be an astronaut?</p>

<p>That’s not a reinvention. That’s a specific job. If you like “outer space” there are many careers. Richard Branson wanted to be an astronaut and started Virgin Galactic.</p>

<p>U) What if I like to go out drinking and partying?</p>

<p>Read this post again in a year.</p>

<p>V) What if I’m busy cheating on my husband or wife or betraying a partner?</p>

<p>Read this post again in two or three years when you are broke and jobless and nobody likes you.</p>

<p>W) What if I have no skills at all?</p>

<p>Read “B” again.</p>

<p>X) What if I have no degree or I have a useless degree?</p>

<p>Read “B” again.</p>

<p>Y) What if I have to focus on paying down my debt and mortgage?</p>

<p>Read “R” again.</p>

<p>Z) How come I always feel like I’m on the outside looking in?</p>

<p>Albert Einstein was on the outside looking in. Nobody in the establishment would even hire him.</p>

<p>Everyone feels like a fraud at some point. The highest form of creativity is born out of skepticism.</p>

<p>AA) I can’t read 500 books. What one book should I read for inspiration?</p>

<p>Give up.</p>

<p>BB) What if I’m too sick to reinvent?</p>

<p>Reinvention will boost every healthy chemical in your body: serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin. Keep moving forward and you might not get healthy but you will get healthier. Don’t use health as an excuse.</p>

<p>Finally, reinvent your health first. Sleep more hours. Eat better. Exercise. These are key steps to reinvention.</p>

<p>CC) What if my last partner screwed me and I’m still suing him?</p>

<p>Stop litigating and never think about him again. Half the problem was you, not him.</p>

<p>DD) What if I’m going to jail?</p>

<p>Perfect. Reread “B.” Read a lot of books in jail.</p>

<p>EE) What if I’m shy?</p>

<p>Make your weaknesses your strengths. Introverts listen better, focus better, and have ways of being more endearing.</p>

<p>FF) What if I can’t wait five years?</p>

<p>If you plan on being alive in five years then you might as well start today.</p>

<p>GG) How should I network?</p>

<p>Make concentric circles. You’re at the middle.</p>

<p>The next circle is friends and family.</p>

<p>The next circle is online communities.</p>

<p>The circle after that is meetups and coffees.</p>

<p>The circle after that is conferences and thought leaders.</p>

<p>The circle after that is mentors.</p>

<p>The circle after that is customers and wealth-creators.</p>

<p>Start making your way through the circles.</p>

<p>HH) What happens when I have ego about what I do?</p>

<p>In 6-12 months you’ll be back at “B”</p>

<p>II) What if I’m passionate about two things? What if I can’t decide?</p>

<p>Combine them and you’ll be the best in the world at the combination.</p>

<p>JJ) What if I’m so excited I want to teach what I’m learning?</p>

<p>Start teaching on YouTube. Start with an audience of one and see if it builds up.</p>

<p>KK) What if I want to make money while I sleep?</p>

<p>In year four, start outsourcing what you do.</p>

<p>LL) How do I meet mentors and thought leaders?</p>

<p>Once you have enough knowledge (after 100-200 books), write down 10 ideas for 20 different potential mentors.</p>

<p>None of them will respond. Write down 10 more ideas for 20 new mentors. Repeat every week.</p>

<p>Put together a newsletter for everyone who doesn’t respond. Keep repeating until someone responds. Blog about your learning efforts. Build community around you being an expert.</p>

<p>MM) What if I can’t come up with ideas?</p>

<p>Then keep practicing coming up with ideas. The idea muscle atrophies. You have to build it up.</p>

<p>It’s hard for me to touch my toes if I haven’t been doing it every day. I have to do it every day for a while before I can easily touch my toes. Don’t expect to come up with good ideas on day one.</p>

<p>NN) What else should I read?</p>

<p>AFTER books, read websites, forums, magazines. But most of that is garbage.</p>

<p>OO) What if I do everything you say but it still doesn’t seem like it’s working?</p>

<p>It will work. Just wait. Keep reinventing every day.</p>

<p>Don’t try and find the end of the road. You can’t see it in the fog. But you can see the next step and you do know that if you take that next step eventually you get to the end of the road.</p>

<p>PP) What if I get depressed?</p>

<p>Sit in silence for one hour a day. You need to get back to your core.</p>

<p>If you think this sounds stupid then don’t do it. Stay depressed.</p>

<p>QQ) What if I don’t have time to sit in silence?</p>

<p>Then sit in silence for two hours a day. This is not meditation. This is just sitting.</p>

<p>RR) What if I get scared?</p>

<p>Sleep 8-9 hours a day and never gossip. Sleep is the No. 1 key to successful health. It’s not the only key. It’s just No. 1. Some people write to me and say, “I only need four hours of sleep” or “in my country sleeping means laziness.” Well, those people will fail and die young.</p>

<p>What about gossip? The brain biologically wants to have 150 friends. Then when you are with one of your friends you can gossip about any of the other 150. If you don’t have 150 friends then the brain wants to read gossip magazines until it thinks it has 150 friends.</p>

<p>Don’t be as stupid as your brain.</p>

<p>SS) What if I keep feeling like nothing ever works out for me?</p>

<p>Spend 10 minutes a day practicing gratitude. Don’t suppress the fear. Notice the anger.</p>

<p>But also allow yourself to be grateful for the things you do have. Anger is never inspirational but gratitude is. Gratitude is the bridge between your world and the parallel universe where all creative ideas live.</p>

<p>TT) What if I have to deal with personal bullshit all the time?</p>

<p>Find new people to be around.</p>

<p>Someone who is reinventing herself will constantly find people to try and bring her down. The brain is scared of reinvention because it might not be safe.</p>

<p>Biologically, the brain wants you to be safe and reinvention is a risk. So it will throw people in your path who will try to stop you.</p>

<p>Learn how to say “no.”</p>

<p>UU) What if I’m happy at my 9-t0-5 job?</p>

<p>Fine. Good luck. You are not one of us.</p>

<p>VV) Why should I trust you – you look like a failure to me!</p>

<p>Do NOT trust me.  But be VERY VERY cynical of someone who portrays himself as a master with all of the answers.</p>

<p>WW) Will you be my mentor?</p>

<p>You have just read this entire post.</p>
