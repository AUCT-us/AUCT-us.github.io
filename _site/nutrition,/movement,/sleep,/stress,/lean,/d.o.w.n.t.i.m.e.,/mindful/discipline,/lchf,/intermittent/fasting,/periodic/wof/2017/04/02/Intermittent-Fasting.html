    <p class="post-meta">Apr 2, 2017</p>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>We have lied to about fasting … it’s not [entirely] malevolence – it’s maybe just fear of difficulty and pain.  Maybe we wanted to be lied to or wanted to believe the myths about fasting … that fasting will push you to be anorexic or addicted to starving, that fasting will drop your blood sugar and make it impossible for you to function, that fasting is way too dangerous, difficulty or scary for amateurs … all of those myths about fasting are untrue … but the big problem is that fasting is abnormal in our affluent culture. Whether we want to admit it or not, humans have succumbed to behaving like herd animals … even though our brains that can burn ketones, ie we don’t NEED to crowd the feedbunk to get our caloric intake – we WANT to be affluent social consumers of cakes and pies.</p>

<p>Getting and living LEAN is not easy … the distinguishing feature of truth is that it is extremely simple, but simple does not mean “easy.” It is not easy managing nutrition using an objective, evidence-based approach for peak cognitive fitness. It is not easy getting the right kinds of exercise, building agility or useful balanced, efficient movement. It’s not easy managing your time optimally so that you get things done and can get plenty of sleep. It’s not easy to attack the world’s problems and remove the ultimate root causes of the stressors out of your life. But it actually is really SIMPLE. In fact, if it isn’t simple … you’re doing it wrong. There are good mnemonics like using D.O.W.N.T.I.M.E. to use to recognize the CAUSES of waste (eg not listening, movement for the sake of movement, transporting, waiting) and fat (eg too much inventory, overproduction, defective output, extras for ego) in all of the realms of your existence.</p>

<p>Getting LEAN is NOT easy, because people are addicted to fat and people are addicts of wasteful thinking … it’s bad enough, but there are also “dope pushers” out there feeding on serving the bad habits of addicts … it doesn’t matter if we are talking about Lean Enterprise, Lean Startups, Lean Production, Lean Manufacturing or just being LEAN individuals … getting LEAN is a matter of managing habits, it is stressful to change approaches to thinking but it is ultimately less stressful when the change you are bringing to your thinking is about removing the ultimate root cause behind the stressors in your existence … and accomplishing that change in thinking is about institutionalizing habits and there’s no substitute for perfect repetition of good movement, better posture with poise and reinforcement of correct habits in order to change [subconscious, involuntary, habitual] thinking.</p>

<p>It is way too easy to criticize all of the different diet and weight loss programs out there … they are ALL miserable failures and do not work SUSTAINABLY … some do work temporarily [with sufficient commitment to drive applied diligence] for a period of six-months to a year or two, but most of the time the body returns to an undesired FAT homeostatic set point.  When it comes to getting lean, there is ONE success out there – it’s in YOU already, it’s what gave you your life, your existence and the body that has been passed to you as a result multiple millennia of intermittent fasting that hundreds of generations of YOUR ancestors.  Your ancestors may not have been perfect, but whether they wanted to or not, they had to use fasting in order to survive to give YOU life. Fasting, like exercise, is a GOOD stress to the body – fasting is a stress that your body might not like all that much, but a stress that your body, mind and soul NEED.</p>

<p>Everybody can lose weight with almost any diet, if they stick with the plan to achieve caloric restriction … the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Biggest-Loser-Bootcamp-Get-Real-Get-Results/dp/084874554X">Biggest Loser Diet</a> is the quintessential example of UNSUSTAINABLE temporary success, i.e. the diet certainly works and achieves impressive results for 6 months, but when the “thrill of the attack” is over and the body’s homeostatic set point drops the basal metabolic rate to survive, THEN weight reduction is unsustainable, the person is miserable AND even though there is no pleasure of consuming food, weight is regained.  The main problem with every unsustainable diet is the <a href="https://youtu.be/v9Aw0P7GjHE?t=43m16s">basal metabolic rate decrease</a> that happens as a result of mere caloric restriction – this means that after six months or so, the weight losses from caloric restriction get a LOT tougher because the basal metabolic rate has been decreased so much that weight gains happen with very low amounts of food consumption while at the same time, the lower metabolism causes the person to feel cold, stressed, uncomfortable, depressed and anxious to try anything but sustaining the program.</p>

<p>Fasting, on the other hands, is a sustainable approach to life because fasting is NOT about caloric restriction – it is a stark extremely that actually drives a change in hormones, reducing the bodies production of insulin and cortisol, the two hormones driving the homeostatic FAT set point. Fasting is also about cleansing, changing the epigentics of the gut bacteria, purging the system of everything that craves sugar … but fasting also has cognitive and spiritual impacts – fasting is about getting rid of a lack of mindfulness, getting rid of bad habits, snacking, eating in the car, eating while doing something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/v9Aw0P7GjHE?t=50m19s">Eliminating all forms of mindless eating</a> is SIMPLE – there are no recipes or complex restrictions or meal plans to develop or remember – there is time available to THINK, to mindfully contemplate and meditate.</p>

<p>In other words, the hardware in your body was effectively designed to intermittently fast … it’s only RECENTLY that we have undermined our bodies by allowing ourselves to become habitually addicted to bad habits, engaged in mindless eating, eating while driving, eating at our desks, eating while watching television or surfing the net.</p>

<p>Fasting is painful, it’s unrelenting pain and therefore fasting is STRESSFUL … but it is STRESS that you need … fasting is like an exercise program that pushes you beyond the point that you thought you signed up for. Nobody should underestimate how difficult fasting is – people do need to understand that, as with exercise and exercise past the point of comfort, there will be benefits … but that doesn’t mean the benefits will immediately be massive; the results will be HUMBLING.  Think of the results as you would body building. Nobody is going to win a Mr. Universe contest after five or six workouts or two weeks of extreme, grueling workouts in the gym … most body builders quit because the results are humbling and they think that “the view is not worth the climb”. Fasting will burn off fat for energy, it will allow you to think with greater clarity, it will allow you to have more creative insights, it will allow you to have brilliant spiritual visions … but FIRST fasting will be stressful and painful and intolerable.  You will NEVER get addicted to fasting.</p>

<p>Fasting is a habit that is far too easy to walk away from … affluent humans do not fast because fasting is not fun … for affluent human beings, fasting is MINDFUL DISCIPLINE.  However, without fasting, you and your species would not have made it this far … fasting is tough, but it is like an abrasive honing tool that sharpens the spear for physical, cognitive, spiritual optimization … but fasting is far from popular. Fasting, particularly at first, really sucks. Fasting has enemies. Fasting is aggressively criticized. Fasting doesn’t help anyone’s business model, selling fasting products will not make companies money or reward investors hoping to profit from the next Viagra.</p>
