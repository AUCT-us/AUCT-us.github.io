  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I like magic as much as anyone else … and I get how features have a way of becoming very useful, then maybe even SEEM essential as developers find ways to add nice things … but the various forms of magic offered by Windows (Microsoft), iOS (from Apple), FireOS (from Amazon), Chromium (from Google), React (Facebook) are VIRUSES … viruses set up to track user behavior, mine descriptive economic data and either use that data or sell it … becoming the basis of most of the market capitalization of $MSFT, $AAPL, $AMZN, $GOOG and $FB WHILE ensuring that consumers pay for the devices, the power to run the devices AND the bandwidth that the data that is harvested.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, it’s not Meltdown and Spectre and other viruses that have been implicated as the bad guy … it’s that there’s way too much magic SHIT running in the background tracking users … and most of that stuff comes from the infrastructure that provides the features that consumers imagine to be part of a modern user interface, ie definitely NOT the Unix command line.</p>

<p>In other words, there’s a little secret that nobody will tell you about Net Neutrality … it’s not YOUR bandwidth hoggery of data flows that is the real problem and it’s also probably not the quality of service or <em>size of the pipe</em> from your ISP … the PROBLEM … behind the concern over Net Neutrality OR the Meltdown, Spectre viruses is the REAL root cause of the problem.  Most of the features that you don’t really need, most of the so-called “continuous improvement” updates nothing other than complexifiers – they are not legit improvements or productivity enhancers. The root cause is YOU … your laziness … your needs for features that ensure that your complex system effectively prevents you from maintaining legit skills … you don’t really know what’s behind all of obfuscating magic because your skillset has atrophied.</p>

<p>So there too many crevices to hide in – there are layers upon layers upon layers upon layers of abstractions covering up the viruses and assorted tracking shit.  The people who have been trained to trust and DEPEND UPON obfuscations like Windows, iOS, FireOS, Chromium, React and other conveniences have <em>soooooooooo</em> much <strong>complete</strong> shit running in and underneath the abstractions built on abstractions built on abstractions built on abstractions … those people are at risk because they trust crap that is built on <strong><em>complete shit all the way down</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Since the real driver behind ALL of this abstraction is that somebody really, really, really wants YOUR data …maybe it’s time for you to look at the infected boil caused by all of the data tracking toxins … doing so will only be moderately painful – mostly, it will open your eyes and get you to start asking questions … if you have not already done so recently, do a <a href="https://datadetox.myshadow.org/detox">an eight-day digital detox</a> …</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://datadetox.myshadow.org/detox/day1/1-make-a-fresh-start">Clear your browser history and cookies</a> …  <a href="https://datadetox.myshadow.org/detox/day1/4-internet-does-not-forget">clean up your cloud storage</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-or-remove-search-engine-firefox">Ditch Google as your primary search engine</a> … if you primarily go to the Wikipedia when you google something, use Wikipedia search … if Amazon, use Amazon search … there are different ways to do it, but with Firefox, using different search engine is as easy as using different keywords, like “g:” or “b:” or “t:” or “y:” for Google, Bing, Twitter or Yahoo, respectively … but ditch Google as your primary search engine, because Google adds tracking gunk … forget what you once thought about Google’s “Do No Evil” policy – Google has re-defined what Evil means.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://datadetox.myshadow.org/detox/day3/2-flush-out-public-data">Flush out the barnacles that Facebook has attached to your tail</a> … log into Facebook and go to <em>Settings &gt; Privacy</em> and look over everthing and opt for the minimal possible exposure, then <em>Setting &gt; Timeline and Tagging</em> to look over everything and again opt for not being somebody else’s pawn … go to the <em>Activity Log</em> and clean it up … don’t tag people without a damned good reason … instead of taking picture of your head, every so often take a <a href="https://dataselfie.it/">data selfie</a> to see how your postings and comments appear to others – if you don’t like what you see, then it’s up to you to change you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spend some time getting REALLY familiar with everything and ALL of the different setting on your browser … then look at other browsers … then spend more time comparing browsers and looking even more critically again … THEN <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">analyze and compare how well your different browsers and the add-ons you have installed protect you against online tracking techniques</a> … <a href="https://datadetox.myshadow.org/detox/day4/3-detox-browser">detox your browsers</a> … add spyware/tracking blockers like <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">privacy badger</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">ensure your communication is encrypted</a> … revisit <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">Panopticlick</a> and then think about what else you could do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be aware of the <a href="http://architectureofradio.com/">architecture of radio waves</a> around you. When you can, SHUT OFF your phone and all other devices – if at all possible, block off periods of the day, when people DO NOT contact you … it’s not just the radio waves, it’s that you don’t need the interruptions. There are times when you have to be available – there are times when you don’t. When you can, break the cycle of being always tethered and available for contact. Reduce how much your phone broadcasts or receives data. Change the names on your devices; don’t allow apps to track your location without a damned good reason. Deny permissions to apps until after you PROVEN to yourself a few times that you will really NEED the apps to have permissions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Routinely go through and 5S your machines … unless you’ve recently done this, it’ll mean UNINSTALLING most of the software on your computer; likewise, UNINSTALL most the apps on your phone … keep ONLY the ones that you DEPEND upon at least once a month. If you don’t NEED the app, stop being tracked by it, stop squandering your bandwith on the updates, stop allowing it to get in the way of what you need. Brutally constrain the permissions of the apps that you think you need but only occasionally use … it’s very quick and easy to change permissions, when the NEED arises … and you when find that you hardly ever actually need the app, you can bury an OCCASIONALLY needed app in a folder so that it stays out of the way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <em>going cold turkey</em> is the type of thing that works for you, you can stop using Facebook and Google entirely … otherwise, try to successively, each day, use Facebook and Google half as much as you used them the day before … the point is to get to the point where you are MUCH, MUCH, MUCH more mindful and careful about what data you ever furnish to Facebook and Google … if you will need to use these things constantly for a project, eg for background research for a novel you’re writing, you may want to set up an alter ego personna for that project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look back through this list and brainstorm the OTHER places where data is being collected on you and things that you need to tighten up … it’s not just Twitter, LinkedIn, Dropbox, Skype, iCloud, or just the other services you use – and not just hardware such as your wifi router or your vehicle – it’s not just your utility providers or your furnace or your appliances or your equipment or all kinds of IoT devices … you should get a better idea of WHO is tracking you and WHY they are doing it.  You should ask yourself when you gave them that right? Have they actually PAID you for providing power and other resources OR for the right to have access to your life … or did they just promise gee-whizzery, some nifty features you will realistically never ever use and then deliver all kinds of obfuscations and MAGIC?</p>
