    <p>The point of reading for me is learn how to learn better than I currently know how to learn. This means that I attempt to control what goes into my mind. I try to read more with a critical perspective rather than just passively watching videos or merely accepting what I read. I try do more or to implement what I have read. I try to experiment beyond what I read in order think more. Most importantly, I try to listen more, to interrupt less, to understand better rather than immediately respond, but I also attempt to find distinctions or differences so that some find me to be argumentative or imagine that I am overthinking things.</p>

<p>The following reading list is far from perfect … there’s certainly nothing magic about it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I try to look at <a href="https://github.com/trending?since=monthly">what is trending on Github this month</a> and maybe understand the general motivation of the repository enough to get a sense of WHY it is trending.</p>

    <p>Specifically,</p>

    <p>I find that words matter, especially for what our words say about us. This means that I read about linguistics, the psychology of word usage, about writing well, about writing persuasively. One of the most interesting things that I have found is something like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/6xbhq6/self_authoring_review_is_the_program_worthwhile/">selfauthoring</a>. I think that other people would find this interesting, not only because the most consequential things that you can read are going to be the things that you have thought deeply about and have written for yourself, but also in a meta-sense for what data that this project provides for serious research about psychology and computational linguistics. I am experiementing with different writing and publishing platforms, beyond microblogging and messaging but probably more focused on that because many of the most important things that people write are short messages (eg a proper commit message in Git). I am also very interested in things like ASCIIdoctor(http://asciidoctor.org/), Amazon or O’Reilly Atlas publishing platforms, Jupyter, Electron.</p>

    <p>As a farmer, I am interested in agriculture for a variety of obvious business reasons, but mostly because life sciences require a perspective that is different from thinking about digital information. My most serious interests are in human nutrition, peak fitness, evidence-based health and that takes me into a variety of topics such as permaculture, Korean natural farming, soil quality and soil building, microbiome optimization, beekeeping and biochemistry of things like  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melittin">melittin</a>, vermiculture, viticulture [and winemaking], pickles, kimchi, fermented preservation methods, probiotics, prebiotics.</p>

    <p>As an engineer, I am very interesting in applied physics but theoretical physics is also something worthy of attention, especially the methods of thinking and thinking together that led to the rapid development of the technology necessary to produce and deliver a functional atomic bomb [and to do it in a nation that we would now consider a least of all lesser-developed nations where there were no examples to follow, the nation was under severe economic and cultural stress and most people lived without indoor plumbing, basic utilities, communication networks or ANY computational facilities]</p>

    <p>As an entreprenur I am an advocate of LEAN thinking in ventures. That means paying attention to the thinking on things like minimum viable product, Conway’s Law and its implication for team communication and startup team’s workflow. I also think about larger economic ecosystems; to some degree, I think about investor motivation, but mostly I think about how ventures are acquired and produce value as part of larger organizations. Macroeconomic theory is really not that useful, it is more necessary to understand <a href="https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/about-us/market-based-management/">market-based Mgmt</a> CFA <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfaprogram/courseofstudy/Pages/cbok.aspx">Body of Knowledge</a>, Seth Klarman <a href="https://files.leopolds.com/books/Margin.of.Safety.1st.Edition.1991.Klarman.pdf">Margin of Safety</a>, Graham and Dodd <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Foreword-Buffett-Editions/dp/0071592539">Security Analysis</a></p>

    <p>Biochemistry, biophysics, endocrinology especially neuroendocrinology are essential topics – it’s a shame that more effort is not devoted to these topics. It’s important to understand why the importance of basic practices matter so much. Things like sleep hygiene, subconscious, rest, neurotransmitters, brain wave measurement are fascinating.</p>

    <p>Most people are fooled by randomness or really lack a solid understanding of the assumptions underlying most of the statistical evaluation used in data science. Data skepticism [or understanding underlying assumptions of measurement systems, data collection and data analysis] is much more important than understanding the mechanics of how to rapidly produce impressive sciencey conclusions. Survival depends upon <a href="https://youtu.be/iEnmjMgP_Jo?list=PLElrASo3VHBxw7L5XhYxv8xagaZUkQYmy">antifragility</a> and not being a sucker – this is not a matter of playing defense, seeking comfort or avoiding new things … it is a matter of shrewdness.</p>

    <p>Working in the virtual realm is essential for productivity. It’s important to understand things like CAD, GDT, automating the tedious but demanding work of tolerancing and dimensioning. It’s not that important for me to understand things like 3D printing or additive mfg since more than enough energy and effort is already devoted to these topics … it’s more interesting to me to look at thinks like craft and workmanship in things like gunsmithing or <a href="http://www.pipemakersforum.com/forum/">pipemaking and pipe restoration</a>.</p>
