  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I have been reconsidering how I should develop or recast my skillsets in order to not only emigrate to life in the virtual realm but to be a more valuable and active citizen in the virtual realm.</p>

<p>1) Golden-rule … I treat others as I would want to be treated; most of all, this requires that I am FRANK, BLUNT and BRUTALLY HONEST with people.</p>

<p>2) Assertiveness for everyone is a matter of pragmatic Stoicism. It is not that “might makes right” or authoritarianism … in this existence, Reality rules – that means understanding Reality and making the best of what options we have. There is nothing to be gained by imagining we are entitled to better options … we must understand Reality as Reality really is, not as someone wants to imagine, hope or fear Reality might be.</p>

<p>3) Communication, especially listening to others, is my obligation. I need to be proficient in the predominant languages of my trades – most of the time, someone else has already solved the problem before, so it is up to me to UNDERSTAND the root cause of problems and to apply existing solutions before re-inventing the wheel.</p>

<p>Beyond these basic , there are still fundamental principles of inventiveness … principles that that I need to refine, extend, think more deeply about.</p>

<h1 id="segmentation">1. Segmentation</h1>

<p>A. Deconstruct, refactor and simplify complexity into separate, independent “chewable” pieces.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Divide-and-conquer workflows, understand value-addition, D.O.W.N.T.I.M.E eliminates waste</li>
  <li>Design ventures to be autonomous profit centers; eliminate cost / complexity / overhead.</li>
  <li>Develop understandable work breakdown structures for large project to tap remote talent.</li>
  <li>Distribute power/control to franchised outlets to serve customers more directly</li>
  <li>Image/Value/Satisfaction segmentation of customer purchase-related preferences</li>
  <li>Kano Diagram – Excitement, Performance, and Threshold product attribute parameters.</li>
  <li>Micro-niche segmentation by demographics, sociographics, psychographics, lifestyles</li>
  <li>Segmentation of ‘idea management’ process into Fertilization, Seeding, and Incubation</li>
  <li>Strength/Weakness/Opportunity/Threat (SWOT) analysis</li>
  <li>Simplifying complexity without losing value with <a href="http://www.basadur.com/howwedoit/TheSimplexityThinkingSystem/tabid/72/Default.aspx">simplexity thinking</a> and <a href="http://www.basadur.com/howwedoit/An8StepProcess/tabid/82/Default.aspx">Basadur process</a></li>

<h1 id="anti-weight">8. Anti-Weight</h1>

<p>A. To compensate for the weight (downward tendency)of an object, merge it with other objects that provide lift.</p>

<p>In a merger of two companies, one ‘lifts’ the other with whatever its stronger features are (distribution system, marketing, methods, capital, etc)
Companies increase flagging sales by making connections with other rising products (e.g. movie tie-ins)
‘This is my depressed stance. When you’re depressed, it makes a lot of difference how you stand. The worst thing you can do is straighten up and hold your head high because then you’ll start to feel better. If you’re going to get any joy out of being depressed, you’ve got to stand like this.’ Charlie Brown

<p>Cash-till assistant is the most important part of a retail organization
Computer help lines were often originally set up with relatively no-technical staff at the front-end, directing calls to progressively more technically able staff the more complicated the problem is.

Product- rather than function- based organization structure
‘Ready, Fire, Aim’ – Tom Peters (18)

‘The seeing of objects involves many sources of information beyond those meeting the eye when we look at an object.
