  <article class="post-content">
    <p>A government has a strategy. The people have counter strategies.</p>

<p>It USED to be that governments had the inside edge on gathering the data and formulating better strategies – but increasingly that is no longer true – governments have inept, inflexible, archaic sub-optimal strategies, whereas people have smarter, more sophisticated, more intensely-responsive strategies.</p>

<p>I do not know <em>exactly</em> why I am so intensely intrigued by things like new computer languages … I almost worry about the fascination sometimes … but I am engrossed in things that enable collaborative workflows like the Julia Language, or tools for collaborative language polyglottery such as the Jupyter (Julia-Python-R) Project, including both Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab and <a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howitworks.html">JupyterHub</a> … but it’s mostly about how language enables thinking – that includes the data analysis that provides the sophistication and accuracies in the strategies of people … I am not particularly interested in policy prescriptions for governments, although I get that people [especially investors and fund managers] can benefit from having <a href="http://quantecon.org/notebooks.html">quantitative economic</a> models [including models of government policy] for their own information and use in their own industries and economic spheres.  I TOTALLY understand that shiny new tools are dangerous for their distractive power and their POWER in providing the WRONG answers. Nothing sends people to the ER like the exuberance of a new power tool. But <em>eventually</em> we figure out how to use the power tool for maximum productivity and, maybe even more importantly, TIMELINESS … and one farmer can PERFECTLY plant more acres of a crop at exactly the right right time with his giant tractor pulling a sophisticated planting implement than armies of planters could have ever planted with their hoes and bags of seed.</p>

<p>joined the <a href="https://jupyter.hackpad.com/">Jupyter Hackpad </a> because I believe that <a href="http://jupyterlab-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Jupyter Lab</a> is really a big deal … sort of like Linux really looked spooky big 25 years ago, when a new riff on the Minix clone of Unix was small enough to be ignored because the gold standard was still a PCs running DOS or Windows NT … but some could generally see that it was a big enough of an idea that you knew it was somehow GOING TO amount to something in the fall of 1991.</p>

<p>Well, I think Jupyter is going to be an even bigger deal because of things like <a href="https://jupyter.hackpad.com/collection/zCqMrBELzrv">Jupyter Hackpad Weekly Dev Meetings</a> … although I still suspect that Jupyter, like Linux, will ultimately be driven by an individual leading a small core development group.</p>

<p>Of course, the <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Jupyter Notebook</a> was already a big deal because of what it means for team workflows … sharing and and walking through code and data science …and since those workflows change, what is important is how the Notebook extends the basic console-based approach to interactive computing in a qualitatively new direction, providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results.</p>

<p>The Jupyter Notebook combines two components: 1) A web application and 2) notebook documents.  The web application is a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output.  The notebook documents provide a representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/2016/07/14/jupyter-lab-alpha/">Jupyter Lab</a> puts extensibility on steroids by making it easy to extend the already venerable <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/jupyter-notebook-for/9781771375030/">Jupyter notebook for data science teams</a> and provide a foundation for continued extensions of <a href="http://jupyter.org/about.html">Project Jupyter</a> with <a href="http://phosphorjs.github.io/about.html">the PhosphorJS libraries</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="swimming">SWIMMING</h1>
<p>My curation of content is not what it should be … maybe it is, but what I am referring to is the explosion of really important ideas in the realm of data science … and the need to amp up one’s situational awareness of development in this professional realm of knowledge … using the tools of data science, ie a Jupyter notebook of notebooks, data visualizations, webinars, code repos and Github codegraphs.</p>

<p>I recently started thinking that I need to spend a fair amount of time … maybe as much as four hours a day (<em>Is that way too much?!  NOT ENOUGH??!!</em>) engaged in skimming / sipping / “swimming in the deep end” from what I call the “Data Science Ecosystem Firehose”</p>
