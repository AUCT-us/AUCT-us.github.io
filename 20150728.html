<p>I am thinking about encouragine young professionals and aspiring entrepreneurs to get serious about career meta-projects.  That means learning how to learn or how to hack the building of an investment portfolio, a personal brand, a solid professional network, an open source repository, a series of startups.</p>

<p>OSCON is a conference put on by an EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL book publisher ... OSCON gets up and dances because OSCON is not about bullshit or fantasy or geekery, OSCON is about practical, proven IDEAS, that are being put to the test, in the severely competitive realm of information technology. So that just begs questions, such as 'What kinds of ideas are you putting into your brain? Blogs? Journal articles? Books? Training? Videos? Social media, eg twitterfeeds? How do you curate your content to cultivate diversity?"</p>

<pre><code>Geography is for comfortable zombies. Leadership is about building COMMUNITIES of IDEAS.</pre></code>

<p>I need to do more. What can I do? Can I brainstorm 200 ideas for building communities?</p>

<p>It is important to think about Conway's law -- organizational coupling, like the destiny of Sodom and Gomorrah, is serious business with thoroughly inescapable outcomes. If you don't want to change the population of people you hang out with, you might think you are strong, but at some point even Samson realized that best outcome of his life was to prepare to die with the philistines.</p>
