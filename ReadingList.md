The point of reading for me is learn how to learn better than I currently know how to learn. This means that I attempt to control what goes into my mind. I try to read more with a critical perspective rather than just passively watching videos or merely accepting what I read. I try do more or to implement what I have read. I try to experiment beyond what I read in order think more. Most importantly, I try to listen more, to interrupt less, to understand better rather than immediately respond, but I also attempt to find distinctions or differences so that some find me to be argumentative or imagine that I am overthinking things.


# Develop your OWN reading list of 25 things to read, suggest things that I should read.

The following reading list is far from perfect ... there's certainly nothing magic about it.

1. I try to look at [what is trending on Github this month](https://github.com/trending?since=monthly) and maybe understand the general motivation of the repository and the emerging community around that repository enough to get a sense of WHY the repository is trending.

   Of particular interest to me, not exactly in this order of priority:

   1. A curated repository of a complete [computer science study plan](A complete computer science study plan to become a software engineer. ) to become a software engineer ... I am especially fond of self-paced learning lists like this; I would like so see even more in other topics, eg [data science](https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go).

       The list of [optional topics in John Washam's list](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university#additional-books) is especially compelling and interesting for me as a reliability engineer ... it is very well-done for a general audience, but I am motivated to expand/enlarge that list to reflect my own interests.

   2. The [Github profile summary app](https://github.com/tipsy/github-profile-summary) is a handy little tool for visualizing Github profiles that utilizes [personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)... not that [rate limiting](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting) of unauthenticated requests at up to 60 requests per hour would be that much of constraint, but authenticated requests associated with a [Basic Github Authenitication](https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/#basic-authentication) or [personal OAuth authentication](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens) get up to 5000 requests per hour.

       The methodology of this repo reminds us that there are tons of compelling [tools to improve workflow and other integrations](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/) being produced by [different developers utilizing the Github ecosystem](https://github.com/marketplace) with [Github API](https://developer.github.com/)

   3.  [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/) is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.

       As more and more people find ways to use Tensorflow, the numbers of those [contributing ](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the repo keeps increasing ... so [the growth of Tensorflow community](https://research.googleblog.com/search/label/TensorFlow), not just the code in the repo [but that, too], has interesting lessons for us.

   4. [Vue.JS](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) is a JavaScript framework for building UI on the web that are arguably more maintainable and more testable than UI built with other JavaScript alternatives such as the popular Angular or React. Vue was designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable and to progressively scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.

       The [Vue.JS roadmap](https://github.com/vuejs/roadmap) provides an indication of why the future of Vue.JS is even more compelling, if the existing ecosystem of [AWESOME vue applications](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue) were not enough to suggest what is possible.

   5. [Sindre Sorhus's curated list of curated AWESOME lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) is great example crowdsourced community content.

       Curators try to only include actual awesome stuff in their lists. Curating, rather than just collecting means being selective and annotating the list with descriptions about why it's on the list and how a reader will benefit from it.

2. I find that words matter, especially for what our words say about us. This means that I read about linguistics, the psychology of word usage, about writing well, about writing persuasively. One of the most interesting things that I have found is something like [selfauthoring](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/6xbhq6/self_authoring_review_is_the_program_worthwhile/). I think that other people would find this interesting, not only because the most consequential things that you can read are going to be the things that you have thought deeply about and have written for yourself, but also in a meta-sense for what data that this project provides for serious research about psychology and computational linguistics. I am experiementing with different writing and publishing platforms, beyond microblogging and messaging but probably more focused on that because many of the most important things that people write are short messages (eg a proper commit message in Git). I am also very interested in things like ASCIIdoctor(http://asciidoctor.org/), Amazon or O'Reilly Atlas publishing platforms, Jupyter, Electron.

3. As a farmer, I am interested in agriculture for a variety of obvious business reasons, but mostly because life sciences require a perspective that is different from thinking about digital information. My most serious interests are in human nutrition, peak fitness, evidence-based health and that takes me into a variety of topics such as permaculture, Korean natural farming, soil quality and soil building, microbiome optimization, beekeeping and biochemistry of things like  [melittin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melittin), vermiculture, viticulture [and winemaking], pickles, kimchi, fermented preservation methods, probiotics, prebiotics.

4. As an engineer, I am very interesting in applied physics but theoretical physics is also something worthy of attention, especially the methods of thinking and thinking together that led to the rapid development of the technology necessary to produce and deliver a functional atomic bomb [and to do it in a nation that we would now consider a least of all lesser-developed nations where there were no examples to follow, the nation was under severe economic and cultural stress and most people lived without indoor plumbing, basic utilities, communication networks or ANY computational facilities]

5. As an entreprenur I am an advocate of LEAN thinking in ventures. That means paying attention to the thinking on things like minimum viable product, Conway's Law and its implication for team communication and startup team's workflow. I also think about larger economic ecosystems; to some degree, I think about investor motivation, but mostly I think about how ventures are acquired and produce value as part of larger organizations. Macroeconomic theory is really not that useful, it is more necessary to understand [market-based Mgmt](https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/about-us/market-based-management/) CFA [Body of Knowledge](https://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfaprogram/courseofstudy/Pages/cbok.aspx), Seth Klarman [Margin of Safety](https://files.leopolds.com/books/Margin.of.Safety.1st.Edition.1991.Klarman.pdf), Graham and Dodd [Security Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Foreword-Buffett-Editions/dp/0071592539)

6. Fintech, smart contracts, trust networks, [digital crytpocurrency](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Meiklejohn/), [bitcoin](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin/9781491902639/) technological stack and how it has driven culture and cryptocurrencies; study the distributed, decentralized architecture of [blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb68nxJHvj10JvS-lebOb-FHHeWUMpwKO) database technology


7. Biochemistry, biophysics, endocrinology especially neuroendocrinology are essential topics -- it's a shame that more effort is not devoted to these topics. It's important to understand why the importance of basic practices matter so much. Things like sleep hygiene, subconscious, rest, neurotransmitters, brain wave measurement are fascinating.

8. Read theology and ancient texts to understand how people have contemplated much larger things for thousands of years. Read scripture and Stoics, Seneca, ancient texts of different writers from different cultures

9. Political economics and social choice theory, Dunbar number, network effects, cultures, information, market-based management, [the law](http://bastiat.org/en/the_law.html#SECTION_G004)


10. I am intrigued by [really high-quality audio podcasting](https://gimletmedia.com/about/) as well as photograhy and video content. Part of this includes understanding web services like [Audible/Amazon Audiobook Creation Exchange(ACX)](https://blog.acx.com/) and how people use them well.

11. Architecture, design, landscaping, sculpture, jazz and [art that really matters](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLElrASo3VHBxt9zg3oRoKSqmyiCHct4Ai) when it comes to inspiring thinking and collaboration.


12. Most people are fooled by randomness or really lack a solid understanding of the assumptions underlying most of the statistical evaluation used in data science. Data skepticism [or understanding underlying assumptions of measurement systems, data collection and data analysis] is much more important than understanding the mechanics of how to rapidly produce impressive sciencey conclusions. Survival depends upon [antifragility](https://youtu.be/iEnmjMgP_Jo?list=PLElrASo3VHBxw7L5XhYxv8xagaZUkQYmy) and not being a sucker -- this is not a matter of playing defense, seeking comfort or avoiding new things ... it is a matter of shrewdness.

13. Working in the virtual realm is essential for productivity. It's important to understand things like CAD, GDT, automating the tedious but demanding work of tolerancing and dimensioning. It's not that important for me to understand things like 3D printing or additive mfg since more than enough energy and effort is already devoted to these topics ... it's more interesting to me to look at thinks like craft and workmanship in things like gunsmithing or [pipemaking and pipe restoration](http://www.pipemakersforum.com/forum/).

14. Israel, Mossad, IDF (understand intelligence collection)... Russia, sambo ... China, Middle east, ancient history of intelligence collection

15. Reliability engineering, SSBB, robustness, tolerance engineering, ToC, LEAN, fault tolerance, FMEA, systems thinking


16. Nanotechnology, seeing problems at entire different levels of scale, scope, time-dependency ... contrasted with geography, astronomy.


17. Pine64, RaspberryPi, Arduino and similar open-source hardware IoT projects, SMART grid/power, data-driven HVAC and buildings


18. Ham radio, software-defined radio, RFID, wireless communication infrastructure


19. Distributed defense and security, crime, more creative ways to solve addiction and different societal problems

20. Home repair, decks, painting, maintenance

21. Avionics, UAVs, robotics

22. Wikipedia ... especially in the processes used for collaborative editing and revision of Wikipedia entries.

23. Jokes and what makes things funny

24. Math

25. Algorithms
