# Why you should read a LOT and why YOUR reading list matters
If you want to make a difference and change the world, you must first change yourself -- the first step is controlling what goes into your mind. If you want to make a difference and change the world, you cannot allow yourself to passively consume content like a sucker -- you cannot be programmed like someone's gadget; you must learn to program yourself and that involves enjoying reading enough to work on your own *craft* of reading fast to quickly understand logic [from illogical writers] and thinking rapidly while reading to be able to appreciate different layers of understanding. **You must learn to READ fast and to enjoy working on your craft of READING in order to be able to READ enormous amounts that you will need to read.**

Reading A LOT is the first step to skillfully curating content and thinking ahead, learning how to learn what will be important and doing more serious work with automating data and data APIs. Advanced work with data is essential for understanding the flow of information [in both the digital and non-digital realms].  Trust, integrity, information security and everything impacting the social contract is all about information flow, misdirection, obfuscation and bias.  Everything is biased and you really don't have a prayer of beginning to understand the biases without the perspective you get from doing a LOT of reading and interacting with other thinkers who do a lot of reading.  If you think this is tough now [and you should or you really don't understand quantum reading], reading is getting tougher every single day and even with better content filters, there is going to be a lot more to read.

# Develop your OWN reading list of 25 things to read ... curate content, OWN that list, be in control and ready to read to control what is going into your brain.

1. Learn how to learn on your own, learn by teaching others, study the process for how the best MOOCs/wikis/content repositories were created
2. Work on ways to be more empathetic, become a listening leader, find ways to accelerate kindness by helping those who help others
3. Nutrition, permaculture, Korean natural farming, soil quality and soil building, microbiome optimization, peak fitness, evidence-based health
4. [Really high-quality audio podcasting](https://gimletmedia.com/about/), [Audible](http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/07/07/amazon-audible-launches-on-demand-audio-service-channels/)
5. Writing and publishing [beyond microblogging and blogging]; evaluate ASCIIdoctor, Amazon or O'Reilly Atlas publishing platforms, Jupyter, Electron
6. Trust networks, [digital crytpocurrency](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Meiklejohn/), [bitcoin](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin/9781491902639/) technological stack and how it has driven culture and cryptocurrencies; study the distributed, decentralized architecture of [blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb68nxJHvj10JvS-lebOb-FHHeWUMpwKO) database technology
7. [Algorthims](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/algorithms-fourth-edition/9780132762564) are a topic that no one should avoid.  You probably can't study too much or delve too deeply into [basic algorthims of elementary data structures, sorting, and searching](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) ... basic algorthim topics include union-find, binary search, stacks, queues, bags, insertion sort, selection sort, shellsort, quicksort, 3-way quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, binary heaps, binary search trees, red-black trees, separate chaining and linear probing hash tables, Graham scan, and kd-trees ... or [graph and string-processing algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII) ... graph and string processing topics include depth-first search, breadth-first search, topological sort, Kosaraju-Sharir, Kruskal, Prim, Dijkistra, Bellman-Ford, Ford-Fulkerson, LSD radix sort, MSD radix sort, 3-way radix quicksort, multiway tries, ternary search tries, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore, Rabin-Karp, regular expression matching, run-length coding, Huffman coding, LZW compression, and the Burrows-Wheeler transform.
8. Mathematic topics, [hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function), [checksums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum), [check digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_digit), [digital fingerprinting algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_%28computing%29), [randomization functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization_function), [forward error-correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction), [network coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_network_coding), [cryptographic ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher), [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)), [distributed databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database) and a variety of topics in [coding theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_theory).
9. Political economics and social choice theory, Dunbar number, network effects, cultures, information, market-based management, [the law](http://bastiat.org/en/the_law.html#SECTION_G004)
10. Physics, especially the methods of thinking and thinking together that led to the rapid development of the technology necessary to produce and deliver a functional atomic bomb [and to do it in a nation that we would now consider a least of all lesser-developed nations where there were no examples to follow, the nation was under severe economic and cultural stress and most people lived without indoor plumbing, basic utilities, communication networks or ANY computational facilities]
11. Jazz and [art that really matters](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLElrASo3VHBxt9zg3oRoKSqmyiCHct4Ai)
12. Fooled by randomness, optimal life in a future that we cannot possibly understand or [antifragility](https://youtu.be/iEnmjMgP_Jo?list=PLElrASo3VHBxw7L5XhYxv8xagaZUkQYmy), not being a sucker, not playing defense
13. Stoics, Seneca, ancient philosopher
14. Israel, Mossad, IDF ... Russia, sambo ... China, Middle east, ancient history
