# Why you should read a LOT and why YOUR reading list matters
If you want to make a difference and change the world, you must first change yourself -- the first step is controlling what goes into your mind. If you want to make a difference and change the world, you cannot allow yourself to passively consume content like a sucker -- you cannot be programmed like someone's gadget; you must learn to program yourself and that involves enjoying reading enough to work on your own *craft* of reading fast to quickly understand logic [from illogical writers] and thinking rapidly while reading to be able to appreciate different layers of understanding. **You must learn to READ fast and to enjoy working on your craft of READING in order to be able to READ enormous amounts that you will need to read.**

Reading A LOT is the first step to skillfully curating content and thinking ahead, learning how to learn what will be important and doing more serious work with automating data and data APIs. Advanced work with data is essential for understanding the flow of information [in both the digital and non-digital realms].  Trust, integrity, information security and everything impacting the social contract is all about information flow, misdirection, obfuscation and bias.  Everything is biased and you really don't have a prayer of beginning to understand the biases without the perspective you get from doing a LOT of reading and interacting with other thinkers who do a lot of reading.  If you think this is tough now [and you should or you really don't understand quantum reading], reading is getting tougher every single day and even with better content filters, there is going to be a lot more to read.

# Develop your OWN reading list of 25 things to read ... curate content, OWN that list, be in control and ready to read to control what is going into your brain.

1. Learn how to learn on your own, learn by teaching others, study the process for how the best MOOCs/wikis/content repositories were created
2. Work on ways to be more empathetic, become a listening leader, find ways to accelerate kindness by helping those who help others
3. [Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR433b0HJY), distributed control systems and Git foundations, Git branching and flow, [Git mastery](https://github.com/progit/progit2), Github, [Github jobs API](https://jobs.github.com/api), the [GitHub blog](https://github.com/blog), taking Git to the next level
4. Look at social media and platforms for managing social media like [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/dashboard) to [effectively network professionally](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/manage-your-job/9781680501377/chap14.xhtml) and manage the ROI of your social media as you LISTEN with analytics and tracking tools
5. Lock at the world of writing and publishing [beyond microblogging and blogging]; evaluate ASCIIdoctor, Amazon or O'Reilly Atlas publishing platforms
6. Look at important cultural developments, eg. [Bitcoin](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin/9781491902639/) technological stack and how it has driven culture and cryptocurrencies; study the distributed, decentralized architecture of [blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb68nxJHvj10JvS-lebOb-FHHeWUMpwKO) database technology
7. Lifehack, find ways to optimize your workflow, your calendars, your todo lists, your inboxes; do a better job of using chat especially if connected to repositories, capture notes with Evernote
8. Become more fit, become tougher, find ways to eliminate your health/wellness weaknesses
9. Become more aware of nutrition, cooking, nutrigenomics; sample your microbiome
10. Become more proficient at communication; use Facetime, Google Hangouts and other alternatives to driving/flying to meetings and conferences; make better use of meetings and conferences
11. Look into video production as well as video surveillance and video security; control your projector; do not passively consume content from others
12. Become proficient at photography and the use of cameras, especially the cameras on your phone.
13. Study cryptography, steganography, hashing, security
14. [Algorithms](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/algorithms-fourth-edition/9780132762564/), [Conway's Law](https://youtu.be/Lwdhw8aI8es?list=PL055Epbe6d5YhDchEvY3O4nIuSLYyrx7K) and thinking algorithmically
15. Mathematics, statistics, physics ... for their own sake ... just because
16. 86400 seconds per day; appreciate every one of them by scrupulously and diligently managing and optimizing the value of your TIME
17. Work at mastery of martial arts and healing arts
18. Study meditation and lojong techniques
19. Appreciate nature without any political bullshit or biases or filters ... raise worms, become a beekeeper, grow a garden in order to be part of nature
20. Appreciate art for the art's sake (not necessarily because you like it or it pleases you); listen to music for the music's sake
21. Learn new databases, concurrency frameworks, languages, RT/FT/security kernels for operating systems
22. Pay attention to LARGER news stories while ignoring MOST of the news; learn a few languages that might really matter ... Mandarin, Russian, English
23. Enjoy history, biography, philosophy, political economy, social choice theory
24. Cooking, food, agriculture, soils, gardening, microbrewing, opengermplasm
25. Do not ignore pop culture, fashion, counterculture ... and of course, [what are the biggest things that are happening in the workplace or work culture right now](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/03/13/culture-why-its-the-hottest-topic-in-business-today/)?


# Git foundations and the Githubification of the professional devops world

- Social Production or Commons-Based Peer Production (CBPP)

# Blockchain and Bitcoin

– Blockchain is the distributed database technology was used as the underlying decentralized ledger for the Bitcoin currency protocol, but many of the most  exciting new use cases have nothing to do with the Bitcoin crytocurrency ... the key thing to understand is that there are three layers of any modern crytocurrency stack: blockchain ledger, the protocol for exchanges and the crytocurrency in secure, digital wallet ... the technologies of wallets, protocols and ledgers are basically independent from one another and technology is certainly independent from Bitcoin hype, culture, economic reports, although those things influence the amount of money flowing into this area of #FinTech development.

– The artitecture of blockchain is basically that of an accounts ledger, but it is a distributed ledger that is not controlled by any single institution. You trust the algortithm rather than the institution.  The algorithms of blockchain are relatively simple; what are highly complex and totally unnerving are the intensely emotional relationships that people have to money.  People might say that they don't understand blockchain or bitcoin, but the reality is that they do not have any understanding about the magical and superstitious trust that they have blindly placed in money so blockchain and bitcoin make no sense ... because they are not secured by MAGIC, like blind faith in politically-driven monetary institution like the Federal Reserve.

– The blockchain solves the double-spend problem by combining BitTorrent peer-to-peer file-sharing technology with public-key cryptography to make a new form of digital money.  A blockchain database is immutable. In the language of transactional database systems, it is CRUD without the Delete. You can never delete a record. Update means add a new record to the Blockchain, it does not mean that you change the record. You don’t have to trust an institution to maintain this record securely (this really matters in countries with lots of corruption at Government level, because those who control the records effectively control who owns what).

– Smart Contracts are “if this then this” business rules automatically enforced by code. Most business contracts fall into some variant of “I will do x, when y happens”. The key is that enforcement is not via courts, it is via code. Smart contracts often use an entity that is akin to an escrow agent where release of funds is based on “multi sig” (multiple signatures) to confirm that funds can be released because an event has been triggered.

- It is worth reading [Nick Szabo]'s [Patterns of integrity](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/10/patterns-of-integrity.html) and [other blogs posts](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/) as well as his [essays, papers and concise tutorials](http://szabo.best.vwh.net/index.html)

# Algoritms and Mathematics
 [Algorthims](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/algorithms-fourth-edition/9780132762564) are a topic that no one should avoid.  You probably can't study too much or delve too deeply into [basic algorthims of elementary data structures, sorting, and searching](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) ... basic algorthim topics include union-find, binary search, stacks, queues, bags, insertion sort, selection sort, shellsort, quicksort, 3-way quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, binary heaps, binary search trees, red-black trees, separate chaining and linear probing hash tables, Graham scan, and kd-trees ... or [graph and string-processing algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII) ... graph and string processing topics include depth-first search, breadth-first search, topological sort, Kosaraju-Sharir, Kruskal, Prim, Dijkistra, Bellman-Ford, Ford-Fulkerson, LSD radix sort, MSD radix sort, 3-way radix quicksort, multiway tries, ternary search tries, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore, Rabin-Karp, regular expression matching, run-length coding, Huffman coding, LZW compression, and the Burrows-Wheeler transform.

 Understanding the abstract, higher level things is always insufficient ... if you don't understand [at least approximately] how the lower level *magic* works, you believe in things you do not understand and you will suffer ... for example, many bitcoin fans believe in the magic of bitcoin, simply because it's the underdog currency while others dismiss bitcoin [along with blockchain databases, bitcoin protocol and the cryptocurrency wallets and all kinds of other alt payments technologies] simply because they believe it is nothing more than the underdog currency or a something pertinent only to the culture of disenfranchised tech geeks.  That sort of superficial understanding is completely insufficent for hardened, rational assesment of a technology ... OR for making choices about ANYTHING in the algorithmically-driven smart.  

 In order to effectively use and design [distributed] databases for lower latency, responsiveness or rapid retrieval [when data is needed], it is necessary think about applying more appropriate or efficient algorithms that exploit the particular attributes of data for managing or indexing data stores.  Toward that end, it is important to develop a better working understanding of things like [hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function), [checksums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum), [check digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_digit), [digital fingerprinting algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_%28computing%29), [randomization functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization_function), [forward error-correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction), [network coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_network_coding), [cryptographic ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher), [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)), [distributed databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database) and a variety of topics in [coding theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_theory).

# Political economics and social choice theory
 If you want to understand government, you need to ask the fundamental questions ... [Bastiat](http://bastiat.org/en/the_law.html#SECTION_G004) was doing this a LONG TIME ago ... but some of us are still trying to work on [overcoming naivete when it comes to government](https://medium.com/@AngrBodhisattva/around-6-30-a-m-on-november-4-1979-in-tehran-4e086e412d9d).
