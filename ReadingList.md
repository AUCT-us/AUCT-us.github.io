# Why you should read a LOT and why YOUR reading list matters
If you want to make a difference and change the world, you must first change yourself -- the first step is controlling what goes into your mind. If you want to make a difference and change the world, you cannot allow yourself to passively consume content like a sucker -- you cannot be programmed like someone's gadget; you must learn to program yourself and that involves enjoying reading enough to work on your own *craft* of reading fast to quickly understand logic [from illogical writers] and thinking rapidly while reading to be able to appreciate different layers of understanding. **You must learn to READ fast and to enjoy working on your craft of READING in order to be able to READ enormous amounts that you will need to read.**

Reading A LOT is the first step to skillfully curating content and thinking ahead, learning how to learn what will be important and doing more serious work with automating data and data APIs. Advanced work with data is essential for understanding the flow of information [in both the digital and non-digital realms].  Trust, integrity, information security and everything impacting the social contract is all about information flow, misdirection, obfuscation and bias.  Everything is biased and you really don't have a prayer of beginning to understand the biases without the perspective you get from doing a LOT of reading and interacting with other thinkers who do a lot of reading.  If you think this is tough now [and you should or you really don't understand quantum reading], reading is getting tougher every single day and even with artificially intelligent curation and content filters along with data APIs and more content available every day, there is going to be a lot more to read.

# Develop your OWN reading list of 25 things to read ... curate content, OWN that list, be in control and ready to read to control what is going into your brain.

1. Learn how to learn on your own, learn by teaching others and developing content for others, study the process for how the best MOOCs/wikis/content repositories were created, explore new self-paced tutorial methods, especially those which blend code, data, text, and video, like [O'Reilly Oriole](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/oriole/)
2. Work on ways to be more empathetic, become a listening leader, find ways to accelerate kindness by helping those who help others
