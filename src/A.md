# 100-Day Roadmap For Tech Collaboration App

The goal is to create, build, develop, improve, but MOSTLY extend and enhance distributed ecosystems of autodidactic, self-starting technicians, developers, engineers, architects, mathematicians, physicists, scientists and artists who collaborate on dogfooding the  technical components of their development workflows by developing and extending open source technologies:

- **Git-Based and Jujutsu-Based Collaboration**: This is CORE to project sharing and the notion of forkable projects under DISTRIBUTED version control
- **WASM Implementation**: For lower-latency browser-based powerful applications, on desktops and mobile, without installation
- **Tauri/Rust/Svelte or something even faster, more secure in the realm of lower-level MLIR compiler technologies**: For reliable, secure performance and cross-platform capabilities
- **P2P communication channels for humans**:  Mostly, this is simply a matter of fora, issue discussions, helping one another for direct collaboration that is ingested into AI and the available as open source LLM models without centralized bottlenecks and parasitic orgs re-selling community data.
- **AI Integration**: For matching, learning, and project recommendations
- **Open-Source Architecture**: To build community and improve through contributions and to encourage open source thinking and drive out proprietary mindsets that tax creators and collect knowledge capital in the hands of those whose core competency is taxing and manipulating the efforts of others.

## Phase 1: Conceptualization & Planning (Steps 1-15)
The 15 steps of Phase 1 outline a comprehensive approach to building a collaboration platform that transforms how technical professionals connect and work together, while simultaneously serving as a catalyst for neuroplastic development. Beginning with defining a core value proposition focused on "auctioneering of fractional skilled labor through guerrilla marketing," the approach evolves through market research examining the "techno-cultural acceleration ecosystem," and technology selection (Tauri, Rust, Svelte, WebAssembly) that prioritizes both performance and human cognitive enhancement. Subsequent steps develop user personas as "neuroplastic development trajectories," define features as "neuroplastic acceleration capabilities," outline MVP requirements as a "neuroplastic development catalyst," and establish a hexagonal system architecture as "cognitive expansion infrastructure"—all aligned with guerrilla marketing strategies like the "Micro-Influencer Swarm Strategy" and "Neural-Triggered Content Optimization" detailed in the Manifesto.

The middle steps establish the project's operational foundations through a development methodology termed "Adaptive Polymathic Development," project management infrastructure for "neuroplastic acceleration," MIT licensing for "cognitive liberation," and a product roadmap framed as a "cognitive evolution framework." These steps consistently emphasize creating not just functional tools but environments that actively enhance human capability development, reflecting manifesto concepts like "Reality Bridging Experiences" and "Synthetic Environment Testing." The approach integrates technical specifics with philosophical considerations about how technology shapes human cognition, relationships, and community development—designing each element to serve both immediate practical needs and long-term cognitive transformation.

The final steps assess technical feasibility as a "neuroplastic growth opportunity," define success metrics as a "cognitive feedback framework," create wireframes as a "cognitive interface architecture," and establish project governance as "collaborative intelligence infrastructure." Throughout all fifteen steps, there's a consistent emphasis that "plans necessarily must be changed" and fixed plans mean "our development work has taught us nothing"—reflecting a commitment to adaptive evolution similar to the "Quantum Brand Evolution" strategy described in the Manifesto. This holistic approach positions the platform to simultaneously deliver practical collaboration tools while accelerating the cognitive development of both users and creators, transforming technical professionals from "passive spectators to high-agency creators" through deliberate neuroplastic design.
