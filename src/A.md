# 100-Day Roadmap For Tech Collaboration App

The goal is to create, build, develop, improve, but MOSTLY, it is NOT ABOUT REINVENTING EXISTING WHEELS. Instead, we aim to extend and enhance distributed toolchains to further existing communities and ecosystems of autodidactic, self-starting technicians, developers, engineers, architects, mathematicians, physicists, scientists and artists who collaborate on dogfooding the  technical components of their development workflows by developing and extending open source technologies.

- **Git-Based and Jujutsu-Based Collaboration**: The fundamental neural substrate of distributed creation, enabling not just code-sharing but cognitive evolution through distributed version control systems. This foundation represents how technical minds develop neuroplasticity through branching, merging, and collaborative conflict resolution—transforming individual mental models into collective intelligence while preserving autonomy and innovation pathways.

- **WASM Implementation**: Creating neuroplastic acceleration through near-native performance in browser environments without sacrificing security. This technology eliminates friction between idea conception and implementation, dramatically reducing cognitive context-switching costs while hardening applications against security vulnerabilities and privacy intrusions through sandboxed execution models.

- **Tauri/Rust/Svelte Neuroplastic Stack**: Leveraging memory-safe, performance-optimized technologies that mirror how efficient cognitive architectures should function. This compilation-focused approach generates applications that respect both machine and human cognitive constraints, enabling cross-platform deployment while maintaining the speed and security necessary for sustained cognitive flow states.

- **P2P Cognitive Network Infrastructure**: Establishing direct neural bridges between collaborators through decentralized communication channels that remain uncaptured by extractive intermediaries. These connections form an evolving knowledge mesh that can be harnessed by open intelligence models while preventing the consolidation of collective knowledge into proprietary silos controlled by rent-seeking entities.

- **Neuroplastic Intelligence Integration**: Implementing AI not as a replacement but as a cognitive extension that accelerates human capability development through intelligent pattern recognition, connection suggestion, and ambient guidance that responds to individual development trajectories while preserving human agency.

- **Open-Source Cognitive Liberation**: Creating accessible frameworks that democratize technological evolution while resisting enclosure by proprietary interests. This architecture enables voluntary communal development that allocates knowledge capital based on contribution rather than control, preventing consolidation of power among those who extract value without proportional creation.

## Phase 1: Conceptualization & Planning (Steps 1-15)
The 15 steps of Phase 1 outline a comprehensive approach to building a collaboration platform that transforms how technical professionals connect and work together, while simultaneously serving as a catalyst for neuroplastic development. Beginning with defining a core value proposition focused on "auctioneering of fractional skilled labor through guerrilla marketing," the approach evolves through market research examining the "techno-cultural acceleration ecosystem," and technology selection (Tauri, Rust, Svelte, WebAssembly) that prioritizes both performance and human cognitive enhancement. Subsequent steps develop user personas as "neuroplastic development trajectories," define features as "neuroplastic acceleration capabilities," outline MVP requirements as a "neuroplastic development catalyst," and establish a hexagonal system architecture as "cognitive expansion infrastructure"—all aligned with guerrilla marketing strategies like the "Micro-Influencer Swarm Strategy" and "Neural-Triggered Content Optimization" detailed in the Manifesto.

The middle steps establish the project's operational foundations through a development methodology termed "Adaptive Polymathic Development," project management infrastructure for "neuroplastic acceleration," MIT licensing for "cognitive liberation," and a product roadmap framed as a "cognitive evolution framework." These steps consistently emphasize creating not just functional tools but environments that actively enhance human capability development, reflecting manifesto concepts like "Reality Bridging Experiences" and "Synthetic Environment Testing." The approach integrates technical specifics with philosophical considerations about how technology shapes human cognition, relationships, and community development—designing each element to serve both immediate practical needs and long-term cognitive transformation.

The final steps assess technical feasibility as a "neuroplastic growth opportunity," define success metrics as a "cognitive feedback framework," create wireframes as a "cognitive interface architecture," and establish project governance as "collaborative intelligence infrastructure." Throughout all fifteen steps, there's a consistent emphasis that "plans necessarily must be changed" and fixed plans mean "our development work has taught us nothing"—reflecting a commitment to adaptive evolution similar to the "Quantum Brand Evolution" strategy described in the Manifesto. This holistic approach positions the platform to simultaneously deliver practical collaboration tools while accelerating the cognitive development of both users and creators, transforming technical professionals from "passive spectators to high-agency creators" through deliberate neuroplastic design.
