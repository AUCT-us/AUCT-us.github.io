# Step 12: Assess Technical Feasibility

This twelvth step builds upon the previous steps and goes on [understand the lay of the land and gather competitive intelligence for the next 88 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#), especially the next thirteen steps in Phase 1: Conceptualization & Planning.  As we know, this work it the first Phase of our seven Phases will tell us if we should even proceed to the last six Phases -- in fact, it is almost certain that we will need to change those last six Phases, but not until after we have learned what we need to learn here in the first Phase.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

### Step 12: Conduct preliminary technical feasibility assessment for WASM implementation

* **Performance Benchmarking**
  * Test WebAssembly performance on target devices and browsers. Compare computation-intensive tasks between JavaScript and WASM. Document memory usage patterns and limitations.

* **Browser Compatibility Analysis**
  * Test WebAssembly support across target browsers and versions. Document feature differences and limitations between browsers. Create polyfill strategy for any compatibility issues.

* **Size and Loading Assessment**
  * Measure compilation output sizes for representative code modules. Test download and initialization times across network conditions. Develop optimization strategies for initial load performance.

* **Development Workflow Impact**
  * Evaluate debugging capabilities for WASM in development environments. Test build time impacts on development iteration cycles. Document tooling requirements for efficient WASM development.
