# Step 12: Assess Technical Feasibility

This twelfth step builds upon our understanding of core value proposition, market landscape, technology choices, whole-person personas, meaningful features, human-centered requirements, holistic architecture, collaborative development methodology, project management infrastructure, neuroplasticity-enhancing licensing, and polymathic roadmapping to [create a technical feasibility assessment that honors both engineering reality and human potential for the next 88 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#technical-feasibility-as-neuroplastic-growth-opportunity). As we continue through the first Phase of our seven Phases, we recognize that assessing feasibility isn't merely about technical constraints but about identifying the optimal paths for cognitive expansion.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This approach to technical feasibility transcends conventional risk assessment to become an exploration of growth boundaries—identifying not just what can be built but how the building process itself can accelerate neuroplastic development across our team and community. By evaluating technical paths with attention to both implementation viability and learning acceleration, we establish a foundation for polymathic advancement through the challenges we choose to embrace.
