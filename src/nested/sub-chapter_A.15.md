# Step 15: Establish Project Governance

This fifteenth step builds upon our understanding of core value proposition, market landscape, technology choices, whole-person personas, meaningful features, human-centered requirements, holistic architecture, collaborative development methodology, project management infrastructure, neuroplasticity-enhancing licensing, polymathic roadmapping, technical feasibility, success metrics, and cognitive interface design to [create governance structures that nurture both distributed leadership and collective intelligence for the next 85 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#governance-as-collaborative-intelligence-infrastructure). As we complete the first Phase of our seven Phases, we establish the decision-making frameworks that will guide our journey.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This approach to project governance transcends conventional authority structures to become a comprehensive collaborative intelligence infrastructure—not merely defining who decides but creating systems that enhance our collective capacity for wisdom, adaptation, and shared purpose. By designing decision processes that honor both individual agency and community flourishing, we establish the foundation for polymathic collaboration throughout our development journey.

## Governance as Collaborative Intelligence Infrastructure

Our approach to project governance must recognize that decision structures are not merely administrative systems but architectures of collective intelligence that profoundly shape how wisdom emerges from diverse perspectives. Each governance element creates patterns of interaction that either enhance or hinder our capacity for polymathic collaboration and neuroplastic growth.
