# Step 1: Define the core value proposition

This first step is about [laying the foundation for the next 99 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#laying-the-foundations-for-platforms-for-tech-professionals-to-find-collaborators-for-projects-and-startups), especially the next fourteen steps in Phase 1: Conceptualization & Planning. It might be worth emphasizing early that the first Phase will almost necessarily lead us to completely revising our approach to the final six stages. We need to look ahead when we are developing thing, especially in conceptualization and planning phases, knowing full well that what we learn in the next few steps will ultimately completely change the plan--but even the idea of the plan, that we know we will have to change or adapt, still helps us as we work through our immediate develop steps. 

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

## Foundations of Foundations

### Auctioneering of Fractional Skilled Labor

This is a matter of accelerating developer-to-developer and developer-to-employer negotiations AND it is a matter of dogfooding the toolchains to do that. The core challenge is creating a marketplace that effectively matches technical talent with opportunities while accelerating the negotiation and team formation process, but it is also about the process of dogfooding one's own toolchain to radically accelerate one's personal workflow, as one learns about building better intelligence gathering practices and connections to find the best tools available today ... because *it's not just that today's tools are better than last year's tools, or last month's tools -- today's tools are better than last week's best tools or even* ***yesterday's*** *best tools.* 

This entire process is mostly CULTURAL, it's not ***exactly*** that the technology moves faster -- it's that, in a culture characterized by AI-assistance, the culture and nature of social interactions between professionals moves much, much faster, ie humans have always had neuroplastic brains and were less fixed than insects, people are NOW, in the AI-assisted realm, rewiring their brains faster than ever. This has big implications for how we develop and extend our technological toolchains.
