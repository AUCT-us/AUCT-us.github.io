# Step 1: Define the core value proposition

This first step is about [laying the foundation for the next 99 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#laying-the-foundations-for-platforms-for-tech-professionals-to-find-collaborators-for-projects-and-startups), especially the next fourteen steps in Phase 1: Conceptualization & Planning. It might be worth emphasizing early that the first Phase will almost necessarily lead us to completely revising our approach to the final six stages. We need to look ahead when we are developing things, especially in conceptualization and planning phases, knowing full well that what we learn in the next few steps will ultimately completely change the plan--but even the idea of the plan, that we know we will have to change or adapt, still helps us as we work through our immediate development steps. 

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

## Foundations of Foundations

### Auctioneering of Fractional Skilled Labor Through Guerrilla Marketing

At its core, our platform is not merely about connecting technologists—it's about revolutionizing how technical professionals market themselves in an AI-accelerated world. We're creating the infrastructure for self-sovereign guerrilla marketing through technology that enables individuals to dramatically compress the negotiation cycle for establishing professional relationships and securing opportunities. By dogfooding our own guerrilla marketing techniques as outlined in the Manifesto, we demonstrate the transformative power of these approaches in real-time.

This isn't just about building tools; it's about creating a meta-system where using the platform itself becomes the most powerful form of personal brand development. When users employ our collaborative systems to build projects, they are simultaneously implementing the very guerrilla marketing strategies that showcase their capabilities to the world. The platform becomes both the means and the demonstration of value.
