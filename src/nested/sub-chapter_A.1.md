## Laying the foundations for platforms for tech professionals to find collaborators for projects and startups

* ***Auctioneering* Of Fractional Skilled Labor -- Helping Devs Accelerate Their Negotiations**

  * We will attempt to identify specific pain points in current team formation processes; how do we help technologists make new friendship and size up collegial relationships more quickly. To do this, we will ask AI to ideate on *the feels* of working together in startups and in open source development communities, in order to analyze why technologists struggle to find or even be more compatible collaborators. We want to explore and document the gap between solo ideation and successful team execution.

* **Value Creation Framework**
  * Creating NEW value is about not falling into the trap of reinventing of any wheels, ie otherwise we should just encourage people to exploit their existing options more fully. We will attempt to define tangible benefits for users joining various platform and where the opportunities for greater improvement are. This is about establishing metrics for measuring even more successful collaborations. We want to create clear differentiation from what already exists in terms of networking platforms or collaboration tools, to build the next step.

* **Target Audience Specificity**
  * Focus specifically on autodidactic, forward-thinkng, execution-oriented (ie doers not ***just*** dreamers) technologists. We want to concretely define the ideal skill level and mindset of platform users that we are trying to further. As we do this, we can think about establishing criteria for the types of projects most suited for the platform.

* **Monetization Potential**
  * This is really where the rubber hits the road. Monetization is necessarily extremely HARD work; it is *somewhat like* how the mechanics of being an auctioneer or orchestrating bidding are actually reasonably simple, but putting together the whole package is HARD. It is HARD to do the work beforehand, to create the enthusiasm or interest that bring many bidders together. The bidders have other thing to do and they know that only one of them can *win* the bidding war, by paying the most to be the buyer. It is also important to involve the seller, to get the seller to best, mostly honestly represent what the seller is selling, ideally in a manner that builds reputation and future interest for the seller's future offerings -- otherwise, it's just a liquidation or dispersal auction of some dead guy's stuff. The auctioneer, or seller's monetizer, must bring the bidders and seller together and to orchestrate the auction, ie the rapid accelerated multi-party negotiaton of price-setting. Doing this HARD process of monetization for sellers is how auctioneers generally ***EARN*** their commissions; some generate *buyer's premiums*, although this is largely just part of the illusion or show ... the commission or buyer's premium is earned on helping the buyer find what they wanted to pay money for and helping the seller cash out. Monetization will involve making a game out of identification of potential revenue streams without compromising the collaborative spirit and the excitement of bringing different parties together. Of course, we will explore mechanisms like freemium models specific to technical collaboration tools, but we will also research pricing structures of comparable development tools and platforms.
