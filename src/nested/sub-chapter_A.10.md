# Step 10: Determine Licensing Approach

This tenth step builds upon our understanding of core value proposition, market landscape, technology choices, whole-person personas, meaningful features, human-centered requirements, holistic architecture, and collaborative development methodology to [create a licensing framework that nurtures neuroplastic growth and collective flourishing for the next 90 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#licensing-as-cognitive-liberation-infrastructure). As we continue through the first Phase of our seven Phases, we recognize that licensing decisions profoundly shape the learning ecosystem our work creates.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This approach to licensing recognizes that our choices about intellectual property directly [shape the cognitive environment we createâ€”either fostering or hindering humanity's inherent neuroplasticity and capacity for continuous learning](https://x.com/i/grok/share/NHz4JDmPR79jFyI0sce3Fe4f2). By implementing licenses that honor openness, accessibility, and collaborative evolution, we establish the legal foundation for both individual growth and collective intelligence advancement.

## Licensing as Cognitive Liberation Infrastructure

Our approach to licensing must recognize that intellectual property frameworks are not merely legal instruments but architectures of possibility that either enhance or constrain human cognitive potential. The licenses we choose directly shape how knowledge flows, how learning occurs, and how collective intelligence evolves across humanity's distributed cognitive network.

### Neuroplasticity-Enhancing License Selection
