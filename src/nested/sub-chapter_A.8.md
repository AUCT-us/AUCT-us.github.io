# Step 8: Define Development Methodology

This eighth step builds upon our understanding of core value proposition, market landscape, technology choices, whole-person personas, meaningful features, human-centered MVP requirements, and holistic system architecture to [create a development methodology that accelerates neuroplastic growth and autodidactic skill acquisition for the next 92 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#development-as-neuroplastic-practice). As we continue through the first Phase of our seven Phases, we recognize that how we build is as important as what we build for transforming spectators into high-agency creators.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This approach to development methodology transcends conventional process frameworks to become a comprehensive neuroplastic practice—not merely organizing tasks but creating the optimal conditions for continuous cognitive expansion and polymathic skill development. By designing our development approach with deliberate attention to learning acceleration, skill transfer, and autodidactic exploration, we establish the foundation for extraordinary growth throughout our journey.
