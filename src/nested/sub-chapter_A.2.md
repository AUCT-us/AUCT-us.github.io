# Step 2: Conduct Market Research

This second step builds upon understanding the core value proposition of this project and goes on [understand the lay of the land and gather competitive intelligence for the next 98 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#understanding-the-techno-cultural-acceleration-ecosystem), especially the next thirteen steps in Phase 1: Conceptualization & Planning. The first Phase of our seven Phases will tell us if we should even proceed to the last six Phases, ie it is almost certain that we will change those last six Phases, but not until after we have learned what we need to learn in Conceptualization and Planning.

By understanding not just the current state but the acceleration vectors of developer tools and culture, this research will position our platform to address needs that are emerging now rather than solving yesterday's problems. The goal is to identify opportunities that align with the neuroplastic acceleration of technical professionals in an AI-augmented world—creating solutions that feel inevitable rather than merely useful.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*
