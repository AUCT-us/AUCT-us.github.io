# Step 2: Conduct Market Research

This second step builds upon understanding the core value proposition of this project and goes on [understand the lay of the land and gather competitive intelligence for the next 98 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#understanding-the-competitive-ecosystem-and-how-existing-technologies-help-those-ecoystems-git-jujutsu-ides-gitbutler-terminals-like-wave-wezterm-to-identify-opportunities-for-differentiation), especially the next thirteen steps in Phase 1: Conceptualization & Planning.  The first Phase of our seven Phases will tell us if we should even proceed to the last six Phases, ie it is almost certain that we will change those last six Phases, but not until after we have learned what we need to learn in Conceptualization and Planning.

## Understanding the competitive ecosystem and how existing technologies help those ecoystems (Git, Jujutsu, IDEs, GitButler, Terminals like Wave, WezTerm) to identify opportunities for differentiation

* **Competitor Feature Analysis**
  * Document core features of each competitor platform. Identify technical strengths and limitations of existing solutions. Map user workflows across competitive platforms to find friction points.

* **User Satisfaction Research**
  * Gather reviews and feedback on existing tools. Conduct interviews with users of GitButler, Wave, and WezTerm. Identify common complaints and unmet needs in current offerings.

* **Market Positioning Map**
  * Create a positioning matrix for all relevant competitors. Identify underserved niches within the tech collaboration space. Document areas where current tools fail to deliver adequate solutions.

* **Differentiation Strategy Development**
  * Define unique selling points based on competitor gaps. Create a feature comparison chart highlighting potential advantages. Develop a preliminary unique value proposition statement based on findings.
