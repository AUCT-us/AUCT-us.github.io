# Step 5: Define Key Features

This fifth step builds upon our understanding of core value proposition, market landscape, technology choices, and whole-person personas to [create features that catalyze neuroplastic growth and polymathic development for the next 95 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#features-as-neuroplastic-acceleration-capabilities). As we continue through the first Phase of our seven Phases, we recognize that the capabilities we choose to build directly shape both user experience and developer cognitive evolution.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This approach to feature definition transcends conventional functionality catalogs to become a comprehensive neuroplastic acceleration framework—not merely listing capabilities but designing systems that transform users from passive consumers to high-agency creators while simultaneously expanding the cognitive capabilities of developers implementing them. By consciously designing features that support autodidactic learning, cross-domain skill transfer, and guerrilla marketing strategies, we establish the foundation for polymathic growth throughout our journey.
