# Step 5: Define Key Features

This fifth step builds upon our understanding of the core value proposition, competitive landscape, technology choices, and whole-person personas to [define features that nurture both technical excellence and human flourishing for the next 95 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#step-5-define-key-features-prioritizing-peer-collaboration-project-matching-and-skills-showcase). As we progress through the first Phase of our seven Phases, we continue to gather insights that will inevitably reshape our approach to the subsequent phases.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This approach to defining features recognizes that we are not merely building functional capabilities but creating architecture for human connection, growth, and purpose. Each feature serves not just practical needs but the deeper dimensions of collaborative creation. By honoring this responsibility, we design a platform that nurtures both technical excellence and human flourishing.
