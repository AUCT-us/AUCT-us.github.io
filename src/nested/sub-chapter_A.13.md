# Step 13: Define Success Metrics

This thirteenth step builds upon our understanding of core value proposition, market landscape, technology choices, whole-person personas, meaningful features, human-centered requirements, holistic architecture, collaborative development methodology, project management infrastructure, neuroplasticity-enhancing licensing, polymathic roadmapping, and technical feasibility to [create success metrics that honor both objective outcomes and human flourishing for the next 87 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#measurement-as-cognitive-feedback-framework). As we continue through the first Phase of our seven Phases, we recognize that how we measure success directly shapes what we value and pursue.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This approach to success metrics transcends conventional performance indicators to become a comprehensive cognitive feedback frameworkâ€”not merely tracking outputs but creating the reflection mechanisms that accelerate learning and adaptation. By designing measurement systems that honor both technical excellence and human development, we establish the infrastructure for continuous neuroplastic growth through informed evolution.

## Measurement as Cognitive Feedback Framework

Our approach to metrics must recognize that measurement systems are not neutral observers but active shapers of perception, attention, and learning. The metrics we choose create feedback loops that either enhance or inhibit neuroplasticity, either expanding or constraining our collective intelligence. Each measurement represents an opportunity to create valuable cognitive feedback that accelerates adaptation and growth.
