# Step 14: Create Wireframes

This fourteenth step builds upon the previous steps and goes on [understand the lay of the land and gather competitive intelligence for the next 86 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#), especially the next thirteen steps in Phase 1: Conceptualization & Planning.  As we know, this work it the first Phase of our seven Phases will tell us if we should even proceed to the last six Phases -- in fact, it is almost certain that we will need to change those last six Phases, but not until after we have learned what we need to learn here in the first Phase.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

### Step 14: Create wireframes for core user flows (project ideation, team formation, communication)

* **User Journey Visualization**
  * Create step-by-step screen flows for primary user tasks. Document decision points and conditional paths within each flow. Identify critical success points requiring special design attention.

* **Interface Element Planning**
  * Define consistent navigation patterns across the application. Document input methods and interaction patterns for key functions. Create component library requirements based on wireframe needs.

* **Information Architecture**
  * Map content organization and hierarchy throughout the application. Define search and discovery pathways for users finding collaborators. Document filtering and sorting capabilities for project and user discovery.

* **Accessibility Planning**
  * Document keyboard navigation patterns in wireframes. Ensure color-independent information conveyance in designs. Define screen reader compatible patterns for complex interfaces.
