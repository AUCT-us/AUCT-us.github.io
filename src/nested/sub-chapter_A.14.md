# Step 14: Create Wireframes

This fourteenth step builds upon our understanding of core value proposition, market landscape, technology choices, whole-person personas, meaningful features, human-centered requirements, holistic architecture, collaborative development methodology, project management infrastructure, neuroplasticity-enhancing licensing, polymathic roadmapping, technical feasibility, and success metrics to [create wireframes that honor both functional clarity and human cognitive patterns for the next 86 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#visual-design-as-cognitive-interface-architecture). As we continue through the first Phase of our seven Phases, we recognize that interface visualization shapes both user experience and team understanding in profound ways.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This approach to wireframing transcends conventional layout design to become a comprehensive cognitive interface architecture—not merely arranging elements but creating visual systems that align with the brain's natural processing patterns. By designing interactions that honor human perception, attention, and understanding, we establish the foundation for intuitive experiences that enhance rather than tax cognitive capabilities.

## Visual Design as Cognitive Interface Architecture

Our approach to wireframing must recognize that visual interfaces are not merely aesthetic arrangements but cognitive architectures that profoundly shape how users perceive, understand, and interact with capabilities. Each design decision creates a mental model that either enhances or hinders the user's ability to leverage the system for meaningful work and collaboration.

### Neurologically-Aligned Interface Patterns

The fundamental patterns of our interface must be designed to work with rather than against the brain's natural processing mechanisms.
