# Step 6: Outline MVP Requirements

This sixth step builds upon our understanding of core value proposition, market landscape, technology choices, whole-person personas, and meaningful features to [create MVP requirements that form the foundation for neuroplastic development across the next 94 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#mvp-as-neuroplastic-development-catalyst). As we continue through the first Phase of our seven Phases, we recognize that our initial product scope must be designed not just for user value but as a catalyst for polymathic growth.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This approach to MVP requirements transcends conventional feature prioritization to become a comprehensive neuroplastic development catalyst—not merely defining what to build first but creating the initial conditions for high-agency learning and cross-domain skill acquisition. By consciously designing our MVP to support both immediate value delivery and accelerated cognitive development, we establish the foundation for transforming both users and developers from spectators to creators.
