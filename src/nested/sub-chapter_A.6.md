# Step 6: Outline MVP Requirements

This sixth step builds upon our understanding of the core value proposition, market landscape, technology choices, whole-person personas, and human-centered features to [outline the essential requirements for a Minimum Viable Product that embodies our values while providing immediate utility for the next 94 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#step-6-outline-the-mvp-requirements-with-focus-on-git-based-project-collaboration). As we continue through the first Phase of our seven Phases, we are creating a foundation that will inevitably evolve as we learn through implementation.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This approach to MVP requirements ensures we build a foundation that embodies our values while providing immediate practical utility. By focusing on human connection, meaningful collaboration, and ethical technology use, our initial offering will establish the right trajectory for future evolution while delivering genuine value from the start.

## MVP as Value-Embodied Foundation

The Minimum Viable Product is not merely a functional prototype but the first tangible expression of our values in action. It must balance technical feasibility with authentic representation of the deeper principles guiding our work. An MVP that contradicts our values of human connection, neuroplastic acceleration, and meaning-centered creation would undermine our purpose regardless of technical merit.
