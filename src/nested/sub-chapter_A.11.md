# Step 11: Draft Product Roadmap

This eleventh step builds upon our understanding of core value proposition, market landscape, technology choices, whole-person personas, meaningful features, human-centered requirements, holistic architecture, collaborative development methodology, project management infrastructure, and neuroplasticity-enhancing licensing to [create a roadmap that orchestrates cognitive acceleration and polymathic development for the next 89 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#timeline-as-cognitive-evolution-framework). As we continue through the first Phase of our seven Phases, we recognize that how we sequence our work directly shapes the learning ecosystem we create.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This approach to roadmapping [transcends conventional product planning to become a cognitive evolution framework](https://x.com/i/grok/share/2sHQTBy5gT8if4dnh6ZMgIwRH)—not merely scheduling features but orchestrating the conditions for accelerated neuroplasticity and applied polymathy. By designing development sequences that honor both technical dependencies and human learning curves, we establish pathways for individual and collective intelligence expansion throughout our journey.
