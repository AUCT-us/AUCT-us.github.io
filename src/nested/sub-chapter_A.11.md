# Step 11: Draft Product Roadmap

This eleventh step builds upon the previous steps and goes on [understand the lay of the land and gather competitive intelligence for the next 89 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#), especially the next thirteen steps in Phase 1: Conceptualization & Planning.  As we know, this work it the first Phase of our seven Phases will tell us if we should even proceed to the last six Phases -- in fact, it is almost certain that we will need to change those last six Phases, but not until after we have learned what we need to learn here in the first Phase.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

### Step 11: Draft initial product roadmap with quarterly milestones

* **Timeline Development**
  * Create high-level timeline spanning 12-18 months. Define key milestone markers with specific outcomes. Establish critical path dependencies between major features.

* **Resource Allocation Planning**
  * Estimate developer hours required for each roadmap segment. Identify specialized skill requirements for specific roadmap items. Create staffing ramp-up plan aligned with development phases.

* **Risk Assessment Integration**
  * Identify potential roadblocks and dependencies for key milestones. Create contingency plans for high-risk roadmap elements. Document external factors that could impact timeline.

* **Stakeholder Communication Plan**
  * Define cadence for roadmap reviews and updates. Create presentation formats for different audience types. Establish feedback collection mechanisms for roadmap iterations.
