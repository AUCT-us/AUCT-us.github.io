# Step 4: Create User Personas

This fourth step builds upon understanding the competitive market research, core value proposition, and humanistic technology choices of this project. Now we [develop a deeper understanding of the whole persons we aim to serve for the next 96 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#step-4-create-detailed-user-personas-focusing-on-autodidactic-execution-oriented-tech-professionals). As we know, this work in the first Phase of our seven Phases will tell us if we should even proceed to the last six Phases -- in fact, it is almost certain that we will need to change those last six Phases, but not until after we have learned what we need to learn here in the first Phase.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This approach to persona development recognizes that the people we serve are whole humansâ€”not just technical operators but spiritual beings seeking meaning, connection, and purpose while navigating rapidly evolving technological landscapes. By understanding them in this integrated way, we can create tools that serve not just their functional needs but their deeper aspirations for growth, community, and contribution.

## Understanding Whole Humans in Technological Evolution

Creating personas is not simply about modeling users as economic or functional actors, but understanding whole people with complex inner lives who exist in rapidly evolving technological and social ecosystems. In the era of AI-accelerated neuroplasticity, we must consider not just what people do with technology, but how technology is reshaping their fundamental sense of self, community, and purpose.
