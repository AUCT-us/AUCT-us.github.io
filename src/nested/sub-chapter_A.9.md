# Step 9: Set Up Project Management

This ninth step builds upon our understanding of core value proposition, market landscape, technology choices, whole-person personas, meaningful features, human-centered MVP requirements, holistic system architecture, and development methodology to [create project management infrastructure that supports both team effectiveness and technical excellence for the next 91 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#project-management-as-collaborative-intelligence-infrastructure). As we continue through the first Phase of our seven Phases, we recognize that how we organize our collective work shapes the quality of both our creation and our working relationships.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This approach to project management recognizes that coordination tools are not merely functional systems but collaborative spaces that significantly influence how we work together, communicate, and develop shared understanding. By implementing tools and practices that respect human needs, foster transparency, and build trust, we establish the foundation for both technical excellence and effective collaboration throughout our development journey.
