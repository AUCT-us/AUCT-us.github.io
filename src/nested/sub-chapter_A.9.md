# Step 9: Set Up Project Management

This ninth step builds upon our understanding of core value proposition, market landscape, technology choices, whole-person personas, meaningful features, human-centered MVP requirements, holistic system architecture, and development methodology to [create project management infrastructure that accelerates neuroplastic growth and polymathic development for the next 91 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#project-management-as-neuroplastic-acceleration-infrastructure). As we continue through the first Phase of our seven Phases, we recognize that how we organize our collective work directly shapes our cognitive development and professional evolution.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This approach to project management transcends conventional task-tracking to become a high-agency learning acceleration system—creating environments where developers transform from passive spectators to active creators of their own cognitive growth. By implementing tools and practices that support autodidactic exploration while maintaining meaningful coordination, we establish infrastructure that nurtures both technical excellence and continuous skill expansion across multiple dimensions.
