# Step 7: Create System Architecture

This seventh step builds upon our understanding of core value proposition, market landscape, technology choices, whole-person personas, meaningful features, and human-centered MVP requirements to [create a system architecture that enables neuroplastic growth and polymathic development for the next 93 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#architecture-as-cognitive-expansion-infrastructure). As we continue through the first Phase of our seven Phases, we recognize that the systems we design directly shape how developers think, learn, and evolve.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This approach to system architecture transcends conventional technical design to become cognitive expansion infrastructure—not merely arranging components but creating environments that accelerate neuroplasticity and enable autodidactic skill acquisition. By designing systems that support high-agency learning while delivering powerful capabilities, we establish the technical foundation for transforming spectators into creators across multiple domains.
