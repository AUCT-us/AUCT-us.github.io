# Step 3: Choose Tech Stack
This third step builds upon understanding the competitive market research and core value proposition of this project and goes on [to select technologies that enable neuroplastic acceleration and cultural transformation for the next 97 steps in this 100-step roadmap](#choosing-technologies-that-enable-neuroplastic-acceleration). As we know, this work in the first Phase of our seven Phases will tell us if we should even proceed to the last six Phases -- in fact, it is almost certain that we will need to change those last six Phases, but not until after we have learned what we need to learn here in the first Phase.

***Plans necessarily must be changed*** and if not, *fixed plans means our development work has taught us nothing.*

This more holistic, mindful or spiritual approach to technology selection transcends mere technical evaluation to explicitly consider how our choices will shape not just individual cognition but human relationships, community development, and spiritual growth. By selecting technologies that serve as infrastructure for human flourishing, we create the foundation for both neuroplastic acceleration and the cultivation of a more compassionate, connected technical culture.

## Choosing Technologies That Enable Neuroplastic Acceleration

The selection of our technology stack isn't merely a technical decision—it's a choice of cognitive infrastructure that will either accelerate or inhibit the neuroplastic transformation of our users. We also should expect that our users will help to transform their colleagues and friends, so this is why we are doing should be thought of as being primarily social. We must choose technologies that function as extensions of human cognition AND opportunities to improve the societal ability to learn, grow and LOVE. 

This approach is about asking what technology is for RATHER than looking solely at technical specs. It's about EVERYTHING in our power that we can do as human beings to enable thought patterns that weren't previously possible. This includes things of a spiritual nature such as the Golden Rule or building time schedules to prioritize time for prayer, meditation and spiritual contemplation.
