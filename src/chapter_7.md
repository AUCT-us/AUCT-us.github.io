# Guerilla Mktg Tactical Implementations

This page provides a very general outline of operational steps for each of your 100 guerrilla marketing themes, focusing specifically on implementation using Rust, Tauri with Svelte, and a cloud deployment approach. This implementation roadmap give an idea of tactical steps for each guerrilla marketing theme. The steps have been specifically tailored to leverage the low-latency and greater security backend processing implemented in Rust; the front-end relies upon Tauri with Svelte for low-latency application interfaces on different devices or browsers.  The plan would be to develop/simulate/debug applications locally at first; then deploy to the cloud for scalable operations but continue to use all of the telemetry tools for highly observable toolchain.
