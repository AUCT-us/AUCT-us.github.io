## Emotional Health

What's the goal?  Utilize the thinking behind the RPE concept from see [Exercise](https://markbruns.github.io/Workouts/Exercise/) from physical exercise when you think about your emotional exertions.

**PILE more POSITIVE stress on yourself ... but never tolerate your bad habits, pointless activities ... and certainly ditch the idea averse complainers or needy time-wasters who are intent on dragging you down with the negative stresses they cling to.**

Ditch the causes or drivers of negative stress ... while you cultivate the drivers and causes of positive eustress or high exercise.

Do not blame people for having short attention spans -- if you are a professional in content marketing, you need to be more professional and find ways to work harder, work smarter and generally make your content suck less. People will have even better choices tomorrow than they do today, so level up your skills.

Push yourself harder to make yourself more relevant to people who work in the realm of ideas, but never push toward being well-liked, especially by spectators UNLESS you want to be an entertainer.  

Add stress to your day [and night] by focusing more on what you know you could have done better and specifically on what you will change tomorrow to be better. Push HARDER each day toward what you know to be right for you.

NO EXCUSES. Never tolerate excusemaking [especially in yourself]. Do. Or don't do. There is no reason to make excuses.

Light workouts, particularly things like gardening or housekeeping, as well as hobbies that are about developing skills in things like home maintenance,  woodworking or gunsmithing helps us to deal with stress and to generally be more emotionally healthy ... although the foundation of empotional health is spiritual health.
