<p>I am a quasi-retired guy, with plenty of scars but really nothing left to prove. I am somewhat like one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfZ6PRXviL0" target="_blank">47 ronin</a> ... one who delights in the battle ... but I do not believe in things likes like imagining that a dramatic end has anything to do with honor or that stupid myths that might hurt others need to be lived out. Life is more interesting than any movie or cartoon, even if it doesn't always seem to be entertaining.</p>

<pre><code>How can leaders enable others to be open source independent thinkerers ...

</code></pre>

<p>Kindness is about helping someone elso to connect the next dot ... not connecting ALL of the dots for them, just the NEXT dot.</p>

<p>The open source universe is full of KIND people ... and it is full of thugs, parasites and people who will never get it.</p>

<pre><code><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI7uaaYeYmQ&feature=youtu.be&t=23m46s" target="_blank">Maybe it's time to stop saying maybe!</a></code></pre>

<p>If we are genuinely kind in the larger sense, we do not want to enable idiots or do everything for everyone.  We don't want to be famous, wealthy or powerful.  We don't want the monopoly on connecting the dots.  We want to push toward more elegant, natural, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1618936/pdf/16849156.pdf" target="_blank">autopoetic</a> systems and that means that we need to get more serious about helping to connecting that next dot ... connecting the NEXT dot, just staying with it, one dot at a time, is what <b>engineering sustainable reliability</b> is all about.</p>
