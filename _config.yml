description: An imperfect child of God 🌟 attempting to become an empath🧎🏾 who cannot possibly ever communicate how GRATEFUL he is to his Creator for every moment of his existence! As we know from Philippians 4:8-9, metacognition is the battlefield we control. To put it simply, are our thoughts ... True? Honorable? Just? Pure? Lovely? Commendable? Excellent? Edifying? Praiseworthy?
