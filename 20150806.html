<p>PERFECT only makes sense when it is used as a VERB.  True warriors will always be committed to perfecting levels of security, not in attaining or settling for PERCEIVED perfection ... improving levels of security is why warriors were created -- they were NOT created to brag about war exploits or about successes or battle scars -- a warrior is ALWAYS training for the NEXT FIGHT ... talking about old fights, old battles, old wars is the mark of impotence and stagnation ... <i>being a true warrior is about training for the next fight -- not train for readiness for the last war, but to be in a permanent state of EMERGENCE.<i></p>

<p>It is impossible to ever be lean enough, rugged enough, secure enough ... achieving perfection in these realms is thoroughly unattainable in this life ... but as long as you want to live and to help others live, you must still keep trying. Consider the case of what happens in weight training -- how much weight you lifted yesterday doesn't matter; what matters is that you lift today and exceed your limits.</p>

<pre><code>How do you train to be more ready to train tomorrow?</pre></code>

<p>I have blogged before about why humility is so important ... but I will openly confess that I still don't understand enough about humility.  Life will teach me and humility might be the most important lesson to learn in life.  I believe that I HAVE TO PUSH HARDER, to fail, to be humbled.</p>

<p>The trajectory of training for the next training session matters ... it has to be a barely sustainable climb and, as with running, you have to climb on those days when you suck at it, when you don't feel that great, when you don't know why you are doing it any more ... the CLIMB of continually training is part of training yourself how to train.</p>

<p>The essence of being a warrior is never giving up on yourself, never settling ... training and pushing limits, but yet training in a way that allows for quiet persistence, sustaining the fight, advancing the cause, HELPING OTHERS ... always reaching out, seeking a way to be of service to people who do things but might need help ... <i>more on this later posts ... <i></p>
