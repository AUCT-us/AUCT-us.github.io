It takes about 1000 days of serious practices in order to be even MINIMALLY qualified to do anything ... a engineering or hard science degree, for example, takes about four years, maybe if you work real hard, you can do in about 3 years and 15 weeks ... working 6 days/week, it takes about 167 weeks to get to 1000 days. My 1000 Day approach involves using an agile work breakdown structure that incorporates the philosophical mindset of Musashi's Book of Five Rings.  

The 167 weeks are broken down into eight twenty-week terms or semesters; there is a one-week planning/re-orientation week between each term. In each 20-week term, there are five 4-week scrolls or agile plan frameworks to work on.

*  Earth -- Basic MVP foundation; prep for seeing Reality exactly as Reality really is.
*  Water -- Jumping in, making a splash, sinking or swimming, playfully making waves and failing.
*  Fire -- Skirmishing, lighting a match to see if the competition's house will burn.
*  Wind -- Testing, prodding, *being the wind* using different speeds, gusts, conditions
*  Emptiness -- 5S, reduce, remove, eliminate, harden the minimal viable product, then simplify it more

EACH one of these scrolls, has a cookbook or recipe for a daily plan ... but for the most part, the general notion is Plan-Do-Check-Act EVERY DAY ... the point is produce an iteration EVERY SINGLE DAY ... in other words, a 1000 day plan, is a 1000 Iterations plan. The point is to do something SHIPPABLE ... EVERY SINGLE DAY.

# Day One, Earth Scroll, Term one

Nobody knows or cares whether you exist ... so SHIP SOMETHING ... because nobody is going to get hurt or upset by something that is not ready.  Of course, it's not ready -- it's Day One, Earth Scroll, Term One ... but the MOST IMPORTANT THING is the discipline. Get up at 4:39. Roll on the jiu jitsu mats. Get your chores out of the way. Check your messages ... and then GET GOING ... and SHIP SOMETHING. ANYTHING.
