<a id="opensourcist" class="anchor" href="#opensourcist" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The competitive PRESSURE on AWS, Rackspace, Google, cloud service providers, data centers...</h3>

<p>Moore's law has been and still is great! Competition always was and always will be great!</p>

<p>So ... WHY aren't we seeing a preciptous drop in the cost of cloud services? </p>

<pre><code>You cannot demand a better price if you are mesmerized by the magic ...
</code></pre>

<p>HINT: It is NOT about the cost of hardware.</p>


<p><img src="https://cloud.google.com/images/pricing/moores_law.png" alt="Cloud pricing is not following hardware cost" height="600" width="600"></p>

<p>The graphic tells the tale ... or, at least, it sets the stage.  Prices of cloud services should be falling faster ... they aren't.  Competiton IS working, competition IS steadily driving prices downward. Providers will naturally want to drag their feet in reducing the price of their services. But cloud services is still a seller's market -- specifically, it is a seller's market for SKILLS. Companies that employ DevOps engineers are where DevOps engineers learn to be more skilled and valuable DevOps engineers.</p>

<p>The dirty little secret of higher education is that college is NOT really anything more than an EXPENSIVE four-year distraction. There is a shortage of DevOps skills because they don't teach people how to be a DevOps engineer or sysadmin in college. Institutions of higher learning are all about suckering people into a con-game. For people with talent, the situation is just like the way college football or basketball underpays its professional atheletes using the excuse that the college cares about academics. College is where the scouts go to pick the players who will get to be part of the farm team, on the path to the Major Leagues, if they can play.</p>

<pre><code>Maybe instead of educating people for jobs that don't exist, we put them to work on interesting things.</code></pre>

<p>Teaching people how to develop and then accelerate their own processes for independently learning how to learn is what <b>engineering sustainable reliability</b> is all about.</p>
