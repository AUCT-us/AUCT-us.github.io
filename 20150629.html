<a id="opensourcist" class="anchor" href="#opensourcist" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The competitive PRESSURE on AWS, Rackspace, Google, cloud service providers, data centers...</h3>

<p>Moore's law has been and still is great! Competition always was and always will be great!</p>

<p>So ... WHY aren't we seeing a preciptous drop in the cost of cloud services? </p>

<pre><code>You cannot demand a better price if you are mesmerized by the magic...
</code></pre>

<p>HINT: Cloud computing ain't about magic and the price is clearly NOT driven by the cost of hardware.</p>


<p><img src="https://cloud.google.com/images/pricing/moores_law.png" alt="Cloud pricing is not following hardware cost" height="600" width="600"></p>

<p>The graphic tells the tale ... or, at least, it sets the stage.  Prices of cloud services should be falling faster ... they aren't.  Competiton IS working, competition IS steadily driving prices downward. Providers will naturally want to drag their feet in reducing the price of their services. But competitive pressure eventually wins.</p>

<p>The market for cloud services is still more of a seller's market than it should be, but why is that?  The market for cloud services is effectively a seller's market for SKILLS and skills development. Companies are the places where skills are efficiently developed in the people that the skills developers [and cloud service providers] hire. In other words, the companies that employ DevOps engineers are where DevOps engineers learn to be more skilled and valuable DevOps engineers. That's where the skills are getting built ... and, so far, there's still a shortage in the number of REAL "educational instiutions" where people learn useful skills. Startups and open source are really beginning to change that, but frankly the REAL educational institutions are sort of limited to the companies like Google, Amazon and Rackspace.</p>

<p>The dirty little secret of the conventional higher education industry is that college is NOT really anything more than an EXPENSIVE four-year distraction. There is a shortage of DevOps skills because they don't teach people how to be a DevOps engineer or sysadmin in college. Institutions of higher learning are all about suckering people into a con-game. For people with talent, the situation is just like the way college football or basketball underpays its professional atheletes using the excuse that the college cares about academics. College is where the scouts go to pick the players who will get to be part of the farm team, on the path to the Major Leagues, if they can play.</p>

<pre><code>Higher education is broken. We should teach kids to learn how to learn.</code></pre>

<p>MOOCs are one way that education is being disrupted, but MOOCs are still flawed, like ALL classroom education is flawed in that the student gets knowledge poured into their head by someone who hopefully knows something.</p>
<p>That's why startups are another of disrupting education, but probably are a much better better way of improving education. Having "students" build their own startups to bootstrap their own education is probably one of the best and most practical forms of higher education out there today ... basically, it's a matter of having kids do what the Musk boys did OR what Gates and Allen did or what Jobs and Wozniak did in order to educate themselves. As a general rule, teaching people how to develop and then accelerate their own processes for independently learning how to learn is what <b>engineering sustainable reliability</b> is all about.</p>
