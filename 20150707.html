<p><i>There’s a “right time” to learn something, and it’s different for everyone. […] No matter where you are in your education, some people will be interested in hearing your struggles. This is an important thing to keep in mind when you’re blogging. Each person in your audience is on a different clock, and all of them are ahead of you in some ways and behind you in others. The point of blogging is that we all agree to share where we’re at, and not poke fun at people who seem to be behind us, because they may know other things that we won’t truly understand for years, if ever.</i> -- Steve Yegge, 2005 (ten years ago)</p>

<p>The right time for you to learn things is IN YOUR FUTURE ... that means that what you have already learning is fine and dandy, but what you NEED to focus on learning is the stuff that you WILL learn -- not the stuff that you have already learned, the stuff that is likely to be obsolete or inapplicable by now.</p>

<pre><code>Those who are good at learning things work on their proficiency at failing.</pre></code>

<p>So adopting a genuine learning mindset is tough ... because learning new things that actually matter involves a degree of pain and frustration and FAILURE.</p>

<p>Pushing through fears and limits usually involves stepping outside a comfort zone to experience that "fish out of water" feeling.  Genuinely, learning something is usually not about sitting in classroom, merely watching television or a meaningless, but entertaining YouTube video, eg mating tapirs or listening to an "inspiring" talk that is [just expansive, intoxicating gas](https://www.ted.com/playlists/180/the_10_most_popular_tedx_talks) ... genuinely learning new things of value is not about comfort.</p>

<p>Learning that matters is hard stuff to do and you need to keeping doing it. Or you will be dead, like the other zombies who imagine that they are still alive. Dead people and dead thinkers take pride in, boast about, have regrets about what they have learned in the past. When it comes to learning, what you have learned in the past does not really matter ... except to give you confidence that you have surmounted challenges and learned about things that really mattered (i.e. lessons that helped you in life). If you want to learn something about learning -- study how a company like Apple has aggressively tried new things, experienced pain, learned lessons, profited ... and went then boldly ahead and kept failing.</p>
