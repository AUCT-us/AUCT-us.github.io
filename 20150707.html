<p><i>There’s a “right time” to learn something, and it’s different for everyone. […] No matter where you are in your education, some people will be interested in hearing your struggles. This is an important thing to keep in mind when you’re blogging. Each person in your audience is on a different clock, and all of them are ahead of you in some ways and behind you in others. The point of blogging is that we all agree to share where we’re at, and not poke fun at people who seem to be behind us, because they may know other things that we won’t truly understand for years, if ever.</i> -- Steve Yegge, 2005 (ten years ago)</p>

<p>The right time for you to learn things is IN YOUR FUTURE ... old lessons might still be relevant, but they might also now be impediments to a more accurate understanding or are no longer even correct or complete. What you NEED to focus on learning is the stuff that you WILL learn -- not what you have already learned. Knowledge must be actively applied in order to ensure its currency or value; it must be re-calibrated to make sure that it is not rusty, but still effective.</p>

<pre><code>Being good at learning things is about the proficiency at failing.</pre></code>

<p>So adopting a genuine learning mindset is tough ... because learning new things that actually matter involves a degree of pain and frustration and FAILURE.</p>

<p>Pushing through fears and limits usually involves stepping outside a comfort zone to experience that "fish out of water" feeling.  Genuinely learning something of REAL, applicable value is usually NOT about sitting in classroom and letting the instructor pour information into your brain... NOT about merely watching television or a meaningless, but entertaining YouTube video, eg mating tapirs ... NOT about listening to an "inspiring" talk that is <a href="https://www.ted.com/playlists/180/the_10_most_popular_tedx_talks" target="_blank" >just expansive, popular, intoxicating gas</a> ... genuinely learning new things of real value is NOT something you get by being comfortable.</p>

<p>Learning that matters is hard stuff to do and you need to keeping doing it.</p>

<p>If you don't keep learning uncomfortable lessons, you will be dead ... just like the other stiff, calcified zombies who imagine that they are still alive. Dead people and dead thinkers take pride in, boast about, have regrets about what they have learned in the past. When it comes to learning, what you have learned in the past does not really matter ... except to give you confidence that you have surmounted challenges and learned about things that really mattered (i.e. lessons that helped you in life). If you want to learn something about learning -- study how a company like Apple has aggressively tried new things, experienced pain, learned lessons, profited ... and went then boldly ahead and kept failing.  The right time to do new things and fail is always going to be right NOW!</p>

<p><i>Visual insights are dangerously persausive</i> ... always try to understand the difference between being persuaded [particularly when someone suckers you with what you are proud of already knowing] and actually learning something -- visual insights can illustrate a point, but they can also mislead. Think critically.
