<p><i>There’s a “right time” to learn something, and it’s different for everyone. […] No matter where you are in your education, some people will be interested in hearing your struggles. This is an important thing to keep in mind when you’re blogging. Each person in your audience is on a different clock, and all of them are ahead of you in some ways and behind you in others. The point of blogging is that we all agree to share where we’re at, and not poke fun at people who seem to be behind us, because they may know other things that we won’t truly understand for years, if ever.</i> -- Steve Yegge, 2005 (ten years ago)</p>

<p>The right time for you to learn things is IN YOUR FUTURE ... old lessons might still be relevant, but they might also now be impediments to a more accurate understanding or are no longer even correct or complete. What you NEED to focus on learning is the stuff that you WILL learn -- not what you have already learned. Knowledge must be actively applied in order to ensure its currency or value; it must be re-calibrated to make sure that it is not rusty, but still effective.</p>

<pre><code>Being good at learning things is about the proficiency at failing.</pre></code>

<p>So adopting a genuine learning mindset is tough ... because learning new things that actually matter involves a degree of pain and frustration and FAILURE.</p>

<p>Pushing through fears and limits usually involves stepping outside a comfort zone to experience that "fish out of water" feeling.  Genuinely learning something of REAL, applicable value is usually NOT about sitting in classroom and letting the instructor pour information into your brain... NOT about merely watching television or a meaningless, but entertaining YouTube video, eg mating tapirs ... NOT about listening to an "inspiring" talk that is <a href="https://www.ted.com/playlists/180/the_10_most_popular_tedx_talks" target="_blank" >just expansive, popular, intoxicating gas</a> ... genuinely learning new things of real value is NOT something you get by being comfortable.</p>

<p>Learning lessons that matter is hard stuff to do. You need to keeping doing it to ensure that your proficiecy in learning and thinking is not stale.</p>

<p>Getting good at learning things is about getting serious about working on the proficiency to persevere.</p>

<pre><code>In any meaningful startup, there are no facts, only hypotheses.</pre></code>

<p><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/lean-customer-development/9781449356576/" target="_blank">Lean customer development</a> is done in five steps:</p>

<p>1) Forming a simple, straightforward, nontrivial, testable hypothesis</p>

<p>2) Finding potential customers to listen to, for their reaction to your testable hypothesis</p>

<p>3) Asking the right questions, without leading them</p>

<p>4) Really listening to full customer response in order to making sense of the answers</p>

<p>5) Figuring out what to build [to form and test the next hypothesis] and iteratively accelerate the process of learning</p>

<p>Persevering means listening to everything, including what you might not want to hear, from the Voice of the Customer, fighting out of your fog from where you are, developing your understanding as you go along. You must start learning and building and training and climbing from the fog, where you are ... training quietly to push your limits.  You do not get to have the best of anyything, you have to make the best of what you have.  Training is necessarily uncomfortable, because human life will always involve an element of discomfort.</p>

<p>If you don't keep learning uncomfortable lessons, you will be dead ... just like the other stiff, calcified zombies who imagine that they are still alive but live in a comfortable past. Dead people and dead thinkers are comfortable, at rest. They take pride in what they have learned in the past and that pride cements their tendency to stay within their comfort zones. When it comes to learning, you must behave as is what you have learned in the past does not really matter ... except to give you confidence that you have surmounted challenges and learned about things that really mattered (i.e. lessons that helped you in life).</p>

<p>If you want to learn something about learning -- study how a company like Apple has aggressively tried new things, experienced pain, learned lessons, profited ... and went then boldly ahead and kept failing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2008-04-21/3m-fail-or-die" target="_blank">People and organizations and empires that cannot fail any more, usually wither and die</a> ... even though stagnation, decline and death can take a very, very long time. That means that until you are ready to die, the best time to learn something new is now ... if you want to be alive, the best time to try something and risk failure is always going to be right NOW!</p>

<p><i>Visual insights are dangerously persausive</i> ... always try to understand the difference between being persuaded [particularly when someone suckers you with what you are proud of already knowing] and actually learning something -- visual insights can illustrate a point, but they can also mislead. Think critically.
