<p>OSCON is a firehose of open source information, or maybe a tidal wave.  There are almost too many good reasons for any OpenSourcist to go to OSCON ... like tutorials and sessions and keynotes and exhibits and other things about OSCON itself ... as well as indirectly related events that take advantage of the OSCON crowd and timing such as the Community Leadership Summit on Saturday/Sunday or the NGINX training and summit on Sunday before OSCON or big announcements and parties (eg Google Kubernetes) during the week ... but the best reason might be osmotic communication, observing and soaking up interactions and the opportunity to make unexpected, but genuinely productive, personal connections with <a href="http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015/user/network" target="_blank">other attendees</a>.</p>

<pre><code>DevConfs should remind us that good code is primarily about COMMUNITIES.</pre></code>

<p>And there are more great people building communities and doing open source projects all the time.  There are even cities now that almost have an open source vibe, if there can be such a thing.  As an example, Portland is always the home of OSCON and OSCON probably comes back to Portland because Portland, unlike Silicon Valley or Seattle or even Boston, is more of an open-source friendly town to visit with plenty of other open source companies, open source devops and other people to meet, other open-source-friendly things to check out, also.</p>

<p>Any serious fan of startups has to love a town with a community of startup accelerators and incubators.</p>

<p>And, maybe ... if I open the kimono and get really blatantly, too honest about it all ... I think the overarching reason for going to the effort of attending a tidal wave like OSCON is the trip home and the subconcious THINKERY that happens as one digests the all of the hoopla, extravagant assertions and few kernels of pure gold ... aside from a few other critically important stops along the way, the big reason for a long drive back from out West after taking in something like OSCON is that I sometimes I really feel that I NEED to get away [from everyone, from the internet, from all diversions other than driving] and just THINK, to re-calibrate my personal bucket list of WHAT MATTERS MOST.</p>
