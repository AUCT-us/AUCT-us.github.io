<a id="opensourcist" class="anchor" href="#opensourcist" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why I went to OSCON</h3>

<p>OSCON is a firehose of open source information, or maybe a tidal wave.  There are almost too many good reasons for any OpenSourcist to go to OSCON ... like tutorials and sessions and keynotes and exhibits and other things about OSCON itself ... as well as indirectly related events that take advantage of the OSCON crowd such as the Community Leadership Summit on Saturday/Sunday before OSCON or big announcements and parties (eg Google Kubernetes) ... but the best reason might be osmotic communication and the opportunity to make genuine, personal connections with <a href="http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015/user/network" target="_blank">other attendees</a>.</p>

<pre><code>DevConfs should remind us that code is primarily about people.</pre></code>

<p>And there are more great people doing open source projects all the time.  There are even cities now that almost have an open source vibe, if there can be such a thing.  As an example, Portland is always the home of OSCON and OSCON probably comes back to Portland because Portland, unlike Silicon Valley or Seattle or even Boston, is more of an open-source friendly town to visit with plenty of other open source companies, open source devops and other people to meet, other open-source-friendly things to check out, also.</p>

<p>Any serious fan of startups has to love a town with that many startup accelerators and incubators.</p>

<p>And, maybe ... if I open the kimono and get really blatantly honest about it all ... I think the overarching reason for going to the effort of attending OSCON for me is the drive home and THINK ... the big reason for a long drive back from out West after taking in something like OSCON is that I really feel that I NEED to get away and THINK, to re-calibrate my personal list of the top 25 projects that I am working on.  I guess that I have found that driving [and NOT flying] big distances [in side trips or without no particular purpose in mind] ALWAYS help me to THINK.</p>
