<p>Remember that the never ending process of <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/lean-customer-development/9781449356576/" target="_blank">LEAN customer development</a> can be described by five steps or five iterative subprocesses:</p>

<p>1) Develop a test-driven development mindset. Test often, rapidly, continually. Think of development as a set of simple, straightforward, nontrivial TESTABLE HYPOTHESES.</p>

<p>2) CULTIVATE A POPULATION OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS willing participate in your tests and listen to their reaction to your testable hypothesis. In cultivating this population, think about scale and expansion.</p>

<p>3) DEVELOP YOUR LISTENING APTITUDES by getting out there and asking the right questions and refining your technique, without leading or trying to be knowledgable. Zip it up and wait for the response.</p>

<p>4) ANALYZE THE FULL CUSTOMER RESPONSE in order to making sense of the answers, to improve your technique and set the stage for the next step.Do your homework, stay engaged and make sure that people know you really care.</p>

<p>5) FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU MIGHT BUILD NEXT as the "scaffolding" for the infrastructure to form and test the next round hypotheses. Rapidly deliver the simplest prototype that can possibly work to iteratively test and accelerate the process of learning.</p>

<p>As you inhabit this test-driven mindset for customer development, think about ALL of your internal and external customers.  Think about all of your personal internal customers, your future self is a customer of your current self.</p>

<pre><code>Tomorrow is a customer of today, the day after a customer of tomorrow.</pre></code>

<p>Design your test for tomorrow is something that builds your fitness AND tests your ability to be fit enough in the future without ruining your ability to work out in the future.</p>

<p>Push as hard as you can but not harder than you can.  Take small steps. Fail small. Risk small failure without pushing into the catastrophic failure zone ... that is what being in a zone of Peak Learning ... or something like that, but you must play with it and make it your own.</p>

<p>Get comfortable with an element of discomfort, but do not masochistically push into the zone of pain. It is necessary to live in order to fight another day.</p>

<p>Slow and steady and <b>persistently pushing the edge</b> wins the race.</p>
