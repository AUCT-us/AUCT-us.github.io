## Autodidactic Study

**Prompt/request, 2:30 2/25/2025.**  *Please develop a 200-module syllabus for my year-long autodidactic study of agentic RAG, building knowledge graphs and working with graph databases, spending approximately 150 minutes per day, 6 days per week. The syllabus should be comprehensive, using the full landscape of latest developments in RAG and AI engineering that you are aware of through your training data. It should be written at Level 6 of Bloom's Taxonomy. It should be in the form of an outline that encourages further just-in-time exploration as I work through the syllabus; in other words, I am not asking for a complete text, I am asking for an outline, in which it is up to me to fill in the material and develop my exercises. Although, it would be helpful to me if you could suggest the most cost-effective approach for procuring the available compute horsepower, either with something like a mini PC or NVIDIA DIGITS machine OR renting compute from different sources OR a combination of both.*

# Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.7 ... Comprehensive Year-Long Syllabus: Agentic RAG, Knowledge Graphs & Graph Databases

This comprehensive 200-module syllabus provides a structured approach to mastering agentic RAG, knowledge graphs, and graph databases over the course of a year. I've included compute resource recommendations to help you make cost-effective decisions about your technical infrastructure.

The syllabus progresses through four main phases:

1. **Foundations (Weeks 1-10)**: Building core knowledge in information retrieval, vector embeddings, graph theory, and database technologies

2. **Advanced Implementations (Weeks 11-25)**: Diving deeper into knowledge graph construction, neural networks, advanced RAG techniques, and agent architectures

3. **Specialized Applications and Research (Weeks 26-40)**: Exploring domain-specific applications, multimodal approaches, reasoning systems, and ethical considerations

4. **Advanced Research and Integration (Weeks 41-52)**: Developing cutting-edge systems and completing a capstone project

For compute resources, I recommend a hybrid approach:
- A solid mid-tier workstation for daily development work (~$3,000)
- Strategic use of cloud resources for intensive training and specialized services
- Managed database services for production systems

This balances upfront costs with operational flexibility, allowing you to scale your resources as needed during different phases of your learning journey.

## Compute Resource Recommendations
