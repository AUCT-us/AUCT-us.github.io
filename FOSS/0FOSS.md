**Auct.US is AGENTIC multi-agent AI ... it is a FOSS tool** ... something that we are building ... for using AI agents to assist us in retrieving information and comparing different sources of information in a market or auction or industry ... we might be interested in a job, in talent acquisition, looking into real estate or other asset prices or things like renting assets, trading exchanges, sharing economies or different mechanism to accelerate political negotiations or standoffs. 

We are big fans of **FOSS**, ***FREE Open Source Software*** ... and yes, OF COURSE, we are huge fans of [Joe Foss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Foss) and his brand of freedom and fighting for freedom ... but in this repository, the kind of *freedom* we are fighting for and the freedom that shows up in our discussions of agentic tools, is about FREELY extensible, open source sortware. Freedom and openness are always good things and **Discipline [of open source] Equals Freedom!**

## FOSS is Free and Open Source Sofware ... it starts with doing background investigations, via autodidactic study

We curate notes and lists in our study process, using different agents including, [GitHub OpenAI GPT](https://auctu.github.io/FOSS/3/), [Anthropic Claude](https://auctu.github.io/FOSS/4/), [Google Gemini Advanced](https://auctu.github.io/FOSS/5/), [Xai Grok](https://auctu.github.io/FOSS/6/). We ask the agents a similar question about developing a syllabus for autodidactic and study and suggestions for the compute that we will need in order work through examples in that study. 

Then we develop annotated lists ... and we make those list somewhat intelligent with our ANNOTIFY app and our RSSistant tools [which is about extending/enhancing tools like Thunderbird] ... but mostly, background investigations are really about doing a LOT of reading ... and being AI-savvy to ensure that our reading time is as productive as possible. 

Curating and annotating AWESOME lists is all about jumping off points for ideas ... our listings are all about open source PROJECTS that we think are pretty darned AWESOME ... not just because of the tools or technology, but REALLY it's about the PEOPLE dev'ing the tools and technology for others to use.

*FOSS ... and fighting for the FREEDOM of open source software ... is mostly about interacting with human beings who are doing really cool things ... taking various theses behind big things and various antitheses behind alterative or competing big things and then synthesizing the next even bigger thing. FOSS is way bigger than just Linux or Git or any tool or all of the repositories of open source code out there.* **FOSS is about really smart, capable human beings creating extremely USEFUL and extensible tools and sharing the creative process with other human beings.**

# Open Source Projects We LOVE ... And Hope To Contribute To

1) **READING** might be thing we need to improve most ... [extending/enhancing Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/get-involved/#development) ... this goes way beyond *just* the 100,000 emails we get every year and the daily work of keeping the daily email fetch down to a manageable 250-300 emails/day. Reading ALSO goes way BEYOND *just* the thousands of RSS feeds from our professional and technical interests that we try to stay on top of. We simply cannot read enough. We need to read even more but *there's only so much reading that is humanly possible!*  So we NEED help ... we need to develop ***much smarter*** *READING technologies* and along with just the tech, we need an even better set of best practices for sharing and communicating about what we have read with others ... but it is the ***much smarter*** *READING technologies*  that we develop with others for our shared needs that will help us to READ more, READ better, READ faster and to generally accelerate our ability to coherently, professionally process more information. *Accelerate the practices for READING, accelerate the READING tools, and accelerate the accelerated development of READING tools* ***so that we are able to slow down and THINK.*** Doing this is really going to be about understanding how the best developers have been dogfooding their own toolkits for the last few decades. We might start by looking into the [Thunderbird development community](https://developer.thunderbird.net/thunderbird-development/getting-started) ... which uses the [Mercurial distributed version control system(DVCS)](https://wiki.mercurial-scm.org/Download) rather than the [Git DVCS](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) [*and just the topic of comparing DVCSs and DVCS practices including distributed issue tracking and distributed code review by itself is an extremely important facet of distributed development*] ...moreover, the Thunderbird community itself is also important since it is part of the foundation of developing different web technologies, including CSS, HTML, and JavaScript at [Mozilla's Developer site MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) ... or, instead of *just* working on the tool itself, we might contribute to the Thunderbird website, this documentation, or addons.thunderbird.net through the [repositories and their issue trackers on the Thunderbird GitHub page](https://github.com/thunderbird). It's worth repeating for emphasis that *dev'ing Thunderbird, and using Mercurial and Git, is really about understanding how the best developers on the planet have been dogfooding their own toolkits for the last few decades* ... and ***the important stuff is still to-this-very-day all dev'd with plain old email!***  Tech is all about ***READING.***

2) **DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL** At first, we just want to master [bread-and-butter, baseline, STANDALONE basic Git commands](https://git-scm.com/docs/giteveryday#STANDALONE) ... then, with experience, we move on up to the [more participatory form of Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/giteveryday#_individual_developer_participant) to the [project integrator level of Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/giteveryday#_integrator) to [repository administration level Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/giteveryday#_repository_administration)... until we reach the point where [whole Git landscape](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) makes some sense ... then, since we care about the Git tool, we subscribe to the [git mailing list](git@vger.kernel.org) or, at least, try to follow the major developments from that list with the summarized [Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/) ... but practically, it really gets into *USING* Git with the [best Gitflow practices](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-flow) or what might be even better, the [GitLab Flow Best Practices](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-are-gitlab-flow-best-practices/) ... which are mostly about doing code review better and things like [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) ... although some of it is about *shifting left further* to use intelligence in the linting/testing/debugging/dev'ing that happens even before code review with a ***GitDeep*** implementations of [generative AI foundation model](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/4f68e07c6c3173480053fd52391851d6f80d651b/On-the-Opportunities-and-Risks-of-Foundation-Models/graph) or a quasi-proprietary, branded approach like [Gitlab Duo's Generative AI Coding Methodology](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/07/20/supercharge-productivity-with-gitlab-duo/) ... but all of these practices, depend upon really internalizing the thinking behind the entire GitLab CI/CD toolkit ... or using a similar GitHub-centric approach with [thousands of Actions to automate a development workflow](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&utm_campaign=2024Q2-Learning-Pathways&utm_medium=product&utm_source=github) like [the OpenCommit AI tool for improved commit messages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/opencommit-improve-commits-with-ai)... but it's all about making the most of what others have done and what sorts of *free* resources are available for open source developers, such as taking advantage of GitLab/Github Pages for development documentation.

3) TBD ... there are lots of little [Apps](Apps.md) we could build ... or might try to build ... at with any app that we envision, we FIRST want to develop an awareness of what else is already out there and build upon what thousands of others are useing, rather than first trying to re-invent our own INSANELY STUPID private-invented-here *Javascript* *React* *Angular* *Python library* snowflake thingey ... but we might want to brainstorm a curated list of the top 25 or 100 or so apps that we will try to be *thinkering on* in our campaigns.
