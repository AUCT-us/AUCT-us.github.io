## Autodidactic Study

**Prompt/request, 2:30 2/25/2025.**  *Please develop a 200-module syllabus for my year-long autodidactic study of agentic RAG, building knowledge graphs and working with graph databases, spending approximately 150 minutes per day, 6 days per week. The syllabus should be comprehensive, using the full landscape of latest developments in RAG and AI engineering that you are aware of through your training data. It should be written at Level 6 of Bloom's Taxonomy. It should be in the form of an outline that encourages further just-in-time exploration as I work through the syllabus; in other words, I am not asking for a complete text, I am asking for an outline, in which it is up to me to fill in the material and develop my exercises. Although, it would be helpful to me if you could suggest the most cost-effective approach for procuring the available compute horsepower, either with something like a mini PC or NVIDIA DIGITS machine OR renting compute from different sources OR a combination of both.*

# Grok3 Think -- Syllabus for RAG AI and Knowledge Graphs

Below is a 200-module syllabus designed for your year-long autodidactic study of agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), building knowledge graphs, and working with graph databases. This syllabus assumes you will dedicate approximately 150 minutes per day, 6 days per week, aligning with a comprehensive, self-paced learning journey. It is crafted at Level 6 of Bloom’s Taxonomy (Evaluation), encouraging you to analyze, synthesize, and critique concepts as you progress. The outline is structured to be comprehensive, incorporating the latest developments in RAG and AI engineering, while leaving room for just-in-time exploration—meaning you will fill in the material, resources, and exercises as you go. Additionally, I’ve included a cost-effective compute strategy tailored to your needs.
The syllabus is divided into thematic sections, each containing focused modules. It progresses logically from foundational concepts to advanced topics, practical implementations, and continuous learning, ensuring a steady learning curve. Each module represents a distinct topic or skill to explore, evaluate, and apply.

Cost-Effective Compute Strategy
To support your study with sufficient compute power while minimizing costs, consider this hybrid approach:
Local Hardware for Development:
Option: Invest in a mini PC (e.g., Intel NUC) or an NVIDIA DIGITS machine with a capable GPU (e.g., RTX 3060 or higher).
Pros: One-time cost (~$500-$1500), ideal for development, testing, and smaller projects like building knowledge graphs or running lightweight RAG systems.
Cons: Limited scalability for large models or datasets.
Use Case: Use for initial coding, experimentation, and projects up to Module 140.
Cloud Computing for Intensive Tasks:
Options: Rent compute from AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for tasks like training large models or processing big datasets.
Cost-Saving Tips:
Leverage free tiers (e.g., Google Colab’s free GPU access, AWS Free Tier).
Use spot instances or preemptible VMs for significant discounts (up to 70% off).
Apply for cloud credits through research programs or student offers.
Pros: Scalable, powerful, accessible for advanced projects (e.g., Modules 141-170).
Cons: Recurring costs if not optimized.
Use Case: Use for large-scale experiments, multimodal RAG, and capstone projects.
Optimization Techniques:
Implement model quantization, pruning, and efficient data loading to reduce compute needs.
Batch process data to maximize resource use.
Regularly monitor usage with tools like AWS CloudWatch or local profiling software.
Recommended Approach:
Start Local: Begin with a mini PC or NVIDIA DIGITS for the first half of the syllabus (Modules 1-100). This keeps initial costs low and supports hands-on learning.
Scale to Cloud: Transition to cloud services for advanced topics and projects (Modules 101-200), using free resources like Colab for prototyping and spot instances for heavy lifting.
Hybrid Balance: Use local hardware for development and testing, reserving cloud compute for production-scale tasks or when local resources are insufficient.
This strategy ensures you have the horsepower needed for your study while keeping costs manageable, likely staying under $1000 for the year if optimized well.
This 200-module outline provides a robust framework for mastering agentic RAG, knowledge graphs, and graph databases. As you work through it, you’ll explore each topic in depth, develop your own exercises, and adapt the material to your interests. Enjoy your learning journey!
