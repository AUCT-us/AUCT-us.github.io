*Yeah, yeah, yeah ... I get it ... you don't need to tell me that I should spend a lot more time ***developing*** workouts and drills ... and by *developing*, I mean, I should be actually ***doing more*** of those workouts and drills ... *I've heard that happy horseshit coaching nonsense at least million times before* ... ***IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY FOR ME!*** ... the unfortunate truth is that I am autistic and clumsy.

The only way that I am going to ever DO *anything* is if I can ***thunker*** it through beforehand ... so this page is an thunkering artifact, from the *thinkering*.  

Thinkering is defined [BY ME] as thinking, trying, tinkering with, experimenting by doing it wrong, then trying to just do it the right way, realizing that I have don't exactly understand the *right way* of it and then going to Gemini Advanced or Copilot to ask questions and then repeating the whole process. Thinkering is a lot of NOT-REALLY-DOING-IT-but-picking-at-it-from-the-sides with different timings and choreography first ... but it's the only way that an autistic person like me can get anything really *thunkered* through.



# Six Pillars of Health

All of the PILLARS upon which your health is built are built through repitition of workouts ... workouts need to learned through the process of IMMERSION ... IMMERSION is the same way you learned to speak and THINK in your native language.  How you THINK is everything ... the workouts make it so that you don't even have to MANUALLLY think about it ... the memory from repitions makes the THINKING AUTOMATIC ... but you still have thought through what you are doing ... it's AUTOMATIC, but not MINDLESS ... because YOU did the repititions ... ***YOU KNOW*** ... so *KNOWING* in this manner is the opposite of just mindlessly accepting what an expert has told you ...*you KNOW, not only because you have actually done the repititions* but because ***YOU actually built the workout, too.***

IMMERSION is about ***doing it*** WRONG at first, getting corrected, trying again, finding out you suck again, trying again and then, finally, after a lot of proven successful repititions, you eventually do it so right that you no longer can do it wrong ... and, you don't want to see anyone else waste time doing it wrong ... IMMERSION ultimately eventually requires explaining what you have found in your own workouts to be the right way to others who are still not sure what they are doing wrong ... 

## Spiritual health

The only form of health that actually really matters is spiritual health ... get this one right and the others have a better chance of following ... but if they don't, *SO EFFING WHAT?* **Spiritual health is the only one you really NEED.**

I try to focus upon what I am commanded to do as a Christian.  Christ laid out the ENTIRE SET OF REQUIREMENTS for what we must do as Christians in just four verses ... but if you can only remember one verse, ***if you get the first one right, the other three WILL follow; that's guaranteed!***

* [Matthew 22:37](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-37-compare.html): You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.

* [Matthew 22:38](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-38-compare.html): This is the first and greatest commandment. *{HINT: Focus on this one first and foremost. Yes, it will help you when you struggle with the second one; but it's the most important one. Do not blow this one. As Christians, we believe that the only path to God the Father is through Christ the Son.}*

* [Matthew 22:39](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-39-compare.html): And the second is like it, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.

* [Matthew 22:40](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-40-compare.html): On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. EVERTYTHING ELSE in scripture is is just commentary on these two commandments; don't complicate Christianity.

There is NOTHING ELSE that I am commanded to do as Christian ... I generally tend to avoid most humans because human beings are absolutely terrible at following the first commandment ... the second commandment is, in my view, practically optional ... if I get the first one right, I'm okay.

## Emotional health

What's the goal?  Utilize the RPE concept [see below] from physical exercise when you think about your emotional exertions.

**PILE more POSITIVE stress on yourself ... but never tolerate your bad habits, pointless activities ... and certainly ditch the idea averse complainers or needy time-wasters who are intent on dragging you down with the negative stresses they cling to.**

Ditch the causes or drivers of negative stress ... while you cultivate the drivers and causes of positive eustress or high exercise.

Do not blame people for having short attention spans -- if you are a professional in content marketing, you need to be more professional and find ways to work harder, work smarter and generally make your content suck less. People will have even better choices tomorrow than they do today, so level up your skills.

Push yourself harder to make yourself more relevant to people who work in the realm of ideas, but never push toward being well-liked, especially by spectators UNLESS you want to be an entertainer.  

Add stress to your day [and night] by focusing more on what you know you could have done better and specifically on what you will change tomorrow to be better. Push HARDER each day toward what you know to be right for you.

NO EXCUSES. Never tolerate excusemaking [especially in yourself]. Do. Or don't do. There is no reason to make excuses.

Light workouts, particularly things like gardening or housekeeping, as well as hobbies that are about developing skills in things like home maintenance,  woodworking or gunsmithing helps us to deal with stress and to generally be more emotionally healthy ... although the foundation of empotional health is spiritual health.

## Exercise

Getting your Rate of Percieved Exertion (RPE) for 3-4 hours per week is optimal for [increasing your VO2 max with lower intensity zone 2 cardio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RqY5EYOM0k) ... it's not just quantity of steps that you need, you also need to be at that point of percieved where you cannot quite carry on a conversation COMFORTABLY ... but at that optimal RPE level, you are not gasping for breath, either. 


Generally, I kinda sorta *try* to more or less stick with the ***Tabata*** HIIT workout format ... with flexibility and exercise breaks every half hour or so ... it's more important to just look for ways to incorporate extra effort into your day, without being too dogmatic or rigid about this regimen ... but it does helps to have a general structure or regimen or routine to stick to, without thinking too much about it.

I try to do one tabata HIIT as a break from work every half hour ... maybe work is break from the tabatas ... a tabata is an INTENSELY focused push ... a person can tolerate 4 minutes of anything ... thus that's the tabata workout format.

***Each 16 hr workday allows for 32 four-minute tabata workouts*** ... but there are interruptions like phone calls or other unplanned things throughout the day that mean just aiming for a number like 20 tabatas/day is going to be pretty aggressive.

A tabata itself involves 8 sets of reps ... each set lasts for 20s of particulary intense work to get in as many good reps as possible ... then, it's a matter resting or, more accurately, going back mentally through the *thinkering* one has already done in the past about the most right way or bestest-of-all ways to DO next upcoming 20 seconds for 10s ... repeat this 7X to get the 8 sets.

## Nutrition

IMMERSION is about studying the ***right*** way to eat ... if your eating habits are WRONG, there's no substitute for FASTING ... in order to regain control of your appetite and your gratitude for just having small amounts HEALTHY food ... if your eating habits are WRONG, there's no subsitute for FASTING to re-establish your mental self-control and ability to resist addictions to engineered food poisons and snacks that hook you addictively with different sugary flavor explosions.

## Sleep


IMMERSION is about studying the ***right*** way to SLEEP ... get serious about sleep hygiene. 

## Supplements

When in doubt drink more filtered water.

We AVOID routine use of medications like the plague ... this does not mean that we NEVER take an aspirin ... but it does mean that we NEVER routinely take any form of medication. 

We are not averse to using supplements, but we are averse to using them as a crutch.



# Listing of workouts

Our aim with this listing is to never have to think about our next workout ... we want to have roughly 125 good workout ideas in the hopper, to have 25 that we work on at least once a month, to have five that we touch once a week and to have ONE main one that we are focusing on getting right.

20) **Make it a point to notice something that is especially noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent or praiseworthy** ... perhaps some young phenom like [Alex Hormozi](https://www.facebook.com/ahormozi) ... and, **ALSO make it a point of pointing that excellence out or sharing your admiration with others.** "Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable -- if anything is excellent or praiseworthy -- DWELL ON such things. Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me -- PUT IT INTO PRACTICE. And the God of peace will be with you."  [Philippians 4:8-9](https://www.biblestudytools.com/philippians/4-8-compare.html)



In the following 32 Principles from Gracie University ... IN EACH ONE, ponder one or two or three daily ... and over a three-week research period, apply each of the 32 Principle to every aspect of your jiu-jitsu ... and maybe even your life perhaps, since the point of doing jiu-jitsu is to [metaphorically] think through or *grapple with* difficult issues in our lives ... identify and dissect at least nine techniques in which each Principle plays an integral role. Three of the examples should be “as-is” techniques, three should be “enhanced” techniques and three should be “discovered” techniques.

If your opponent does not give you an opening, then create it with an action that triggers an exploitable response. Regardless of the form – direct threats, decoys, disruptions, distractions, etc. – the underlying goal remains the same: [“be first, and be third.”](https://grapplinggospel.blogspot.com/2023/12/be-first-and-be-third-principle-of.html)
