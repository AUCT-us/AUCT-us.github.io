## 1st Priority -- Spiritual Health

The only form of health that actually really matters is spiritual health ... get this one right and the others have a better chance of following ... but if they don't, *SO EFFING WHAT?* **Spiritual health is the only one you really NEED.**

50% of our energy/focus goest to this first priority, 25% energy/focus goes to our second priority, 12.5% to the third priority, 6.25% to the fourth priority, 3.125% to the fifth priority and 1.5625% to the sixth priority ... if we have 112 hrs/week to spend on health, we will spend 56 hrs on this first priority, 28 hrs on the second priority, 14 hrs on the third priority, 7 hrs on the fourth priority, 3.5 hrs on the fifth priority [in addition to the 56 hrs we spend sleeping] and 1.75 hrs/week on the sixth priority.

We spend 3360 minutes/week on this priority ... that's 8 hrs/day on average ... which might be seem like a lot, but it's only 56 hrs per week and it involves our venture philanthropy work and attempts to increase the concrete attempts to show our gratitude ... when, we're talking about our spiritual health, we are talking our PHILANTHROPIC ventures that expand opporunities for OTHERS ... it's not not our PERSONAL business ventures ... this also includes our prayer life and everything that we do to support an improvement in our prayer life ... so 56 hrs a week is about what it takes; monks in religous orders spend double that.

I trying hard to be more focused upon what I am commanded to do as a Christian.  Christ laid out the ENTIRE SET OF REQUIREMENTS for what we must do as Christians in just four verses ... but if you can only remember one verse, ***if you get the first one right, the other three WILL follow; that's guaranteed!***

* [Matthew 22:37](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-37-compare.html): You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.

* [Matthew 22:38](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-38-compare.html): This is the first and greatest commandment. *{HINT: Focus on this one first and foremost. Yes, it will help you when you struggle with the second one; but it's the most important one. Do not blow this one. As Christians, we believe that the only path to God the Father is through Christ the Son.}*

* [Matthew 22:39](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-39-compare.html): And the second is like it, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.

* [Matthew 22:40](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-40-compare.html): On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. EVERTYTHING ELSE in scripture is is just commentary on these two commandments; don't complicate Christianity.

There is NOTHING ELSE that I am commanded to do as Christian ... I generally tend to avoid most humans because human beings are absolutely terrible at following the first commandment ... the second commandment is, in my view, practically optional ... if I get the first one right, I'm okay.
