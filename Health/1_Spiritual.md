## 1st Priority -- Spiritual Health

The only form of health that actually really matters is spiritual health ... get this one right and the others have a better chance of following ... but if they don't, *SO EFFING WHAT?* **Spiritual health is the only one you really NEED.**

I try to focus upon what I am commanded to do as a Christian.  Christ laid out the ENTIRE SET OF REQUIREMENTS for what we must do as Christians in just four verses ... but if you can only remember one verse, ***if you get the first one right, the other three WILL follow; that's guaranteed!***

* [Matthew 22:37](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-37-compare.html): You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.

* [Matthew 22:38](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-38-compare.html): This is the first and greatest commandment. *{HINT: Focus on this one first and foremost. Yes, it will help you when you struggle with the second one; but it's the most important one. Do not blow this one. As Christians, we believe that the only path to God the Father is through Christ the Son.}*

* [Matthew 22:39](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-39-compare.html): And the second is like it, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.

* [Matthew 22:40](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-40-compare.html): On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. EVERTYTHING ELSE in scripture is is just commentary on these two commandments; don't complicate Christianity.

There is NOTHING ELSE that I am commanded to do as Christian ... I generally tend to avoid most humans because human beings are absolutely terrible at following the first commandment ... the second commandment is, in my view, practically optional ... if I get the first one right, I'm okay.
