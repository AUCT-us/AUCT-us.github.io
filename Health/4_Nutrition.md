## Fourth Priority -- Gut Health, Hydratiion and Nutrition

IMMERSION is about studying the ***right*** way to eat [less]... mostly, we want to fill up on water, more water and still more water  ... and maybe some water with tart cherry extract in it.


if your eating habits are WRONG, there's no substitute for FASTING ... in order to regain control of your appetite and your gratitude for just having small amounts HEALTHY food ... if your eating habits are WRONG, there's no subsitute for FASTING to re-establish your mental self-control and ability to resist addictions to engineered food poisons and snacks that hook you addictively with different sugary flavor explosions.

Nutritional health includes appetite management ... that means OMAD, interemittent fasting, warrior fasting and extended fasting ... mostly, it means eating the RIGHT foods in the RIGHT amounts at the RIGHT times, recognizing that you probably afford to do some fasting as you age ... because, frankly, there's not much risk of your anorexia coming out of remission ... you're gonna eat those steaks or pickled herrings or cheeses or peanut butter or favorite meat items anyway -- ***but you don't need the toaster strude!***
