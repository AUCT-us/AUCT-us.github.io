## 6th Priority -- Endocrinological Health, Deficiencies, Biochemical Imbalances and Supplementation

Generally, we don't try to swallow our way to better health ... we correct the root cause ... so other things like failing to get a proper diet or enough exercise are higher priorities.

We not only avoid most supplements, but we also generally avoid time wasted on trying to figure out supplements; just use the Masterjohn's MasterClass, except that we use the cliffnotes version ... when in doubt drink more filtered water.

There's maybe some reason to take magnesium citrate and zinc ... and vitamin D, but it's better to get more sun ... use iodine woundspray rather liberally.

We might take an aspirin, but seldom ever need one ... we strongly AVOID routine use of medications like the plague ... this does not mean that we NEVER take prescription medications ... but it does mean that we never ROUTINELY take any form of medication over an extended period of time.

We are not absolutely averse to using supplements, but we are averse to using them as a crutch ... we are STRONGLY averse to a supplement-first approach to health.
