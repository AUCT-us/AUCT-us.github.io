## Sixth Priority -- Endocrinological Health, Deficiencies and Supplementation

Generally, don't try to swallow your way to better health ... the other things are higher priorities.

Avoid most supplements or time wasted on trying to figure out supplements; just use the MasterClass ... when in doubt drink more filtered water.

There's maybe some reason to take magnesium citrate and zinc ... and vitamin D, but it's better to get more sun ... use iodine woundspray rather liberally 

We AVOID routine use of medications like the plague ... this does not mean that we NEVER take an aspirin ... but it does mean that we never ROUTINELY take any form of medication. 

We are not averse to using supplements, but we are averse to using them as a crutch.
