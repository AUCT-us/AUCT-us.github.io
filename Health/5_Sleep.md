## 5th Priority -- Neurological Health, Stress Mgmt and Sleep


IMMERSION is about studying the ***right*** way to SLEEP ... if we want to get serious about sleep hygiene, we probably need to get serious about why we are NOT able to sleep, ie active, healthy, fit people generally don't have problems sleeping ... that usually means responding to stress on our schedule, according to our agenda to get at the root cause of the stress, rather than involuntarily reacting to stressors at all hours of the day ... this is sleep hygience might seem kind of simple, whereas [Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_stress_reduction) requires some conscious effort and diligence.
