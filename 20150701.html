<a id="opensourcist" class="anchor" href="#opensourcist" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Think about accelerating YOUR processes of learning how to learn...</h3>

<p>The printing press changed everything. There simply was no way for tribes that depended upon a culture of orally passed-down stories, myths and traditions to wage war against a nation that could use written materials effective to build upon its knowledge capital and learn from its past. Mysticism, witchcraft and wizardry was driven into the dirt by an industrially-produced tank powered by organization, communication and coordination.</p>

<p>But computing, networks, digital information, smart things and big data is probably ushering in just as big of a change ... it is not so much about what WAS written and what learned scholars believe any more, it is increasingly about applying measurement and data science, developing skills and designing for speed of delivery as we build distributed data structures that are forward-looking enough to profit from what the data WILL show us.</p>

<p> Real learning is not about what we know now, real learning is about what we will need to know in five or ten years and how we will learn to get where we need to be. Humans thrive because of their adaptivity; real learning is about <i>adaptivity squared</i> ... not just learning, but learning how to learn.</p>

<pre><code>In times of change, the FORMERLY learned experts are mostly just WRONG.</code></pre>

<p>If you want to learn how to learn, the first thing to unlearn is the allocation of time, specifically the overallocation of time to playing defense. Antifragility is NOT a synonym for robustness. It is not about surviving chaos, antifragility is about profiting from chaos. We will see chaos get a lot worse, because people are still suckers for hype and more media and marketing resources than ever are going to be using communication technology and social media to drown us in hype.</p>

<p>And that is perfectly okay!</p>

<p>Because the process of learning is really not all THAT chaotic, even when the chaos is being driven to new levels by herds of newly-enabled players in the bovine world of media ... reporters are always among the last to know, politicians are the very last ... but really LEARNING about what is going on is perhaps like surfing or learning to ride waves without getting pounded into the ocean floor in some sort of wipeout.</p>

<p>Consider, for example, the well-known hype cycle that we see in most emerging technologies. {WARNING: The hype cycle itself might have been overhyped.} Obviousy, if the hype cycle is still accurate, the ~smart~ way to play the hype cycle would be to pay attention to the hype without falling for it, but instead to step back and thoroughly judge reactions that people have. Understand what people REALLY want and where the REAL value is  (i.e. technologies that slowly grow and build so that adoptioins never plateaus) in new technology and WAIT, learning and plotting strategy. Then "buy" in heavily (e.g. invest, learn everything you can) when REAL value is still in the "Trough of Disillusionment."</p>

<p>Right now, the conventional wisdom of the masses and the journos covering technology might be something along the lines that Big Data, the Internet of Things or crowdfunding were completely overhyped ... they were in 2012, but time marches on.</p>

<pre><code>Don't be a hypester or a sucker. Learn to ride the wave.</code></pre>

<p>Learn how to learn. If you are not already doing so, start thinking programatically -- think about how you are going to USE a LOT more data.</p>
<p>Work every day at accelerating your own processes to learn how to learn ... harvest hype and sift it down to distill where the REAL value is and WAIT for the bovines to understand that they have been suckered.</p>
