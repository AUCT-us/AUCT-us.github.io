# The Importance of Curating Annotated Reading Lists

I believe that curating annotated reading lists ... not only helps one keep reading and re-reading interesting materials ... but the process of curating such a lists publicly helps one to think about the context of what one has read and what it's impact is ... doing this publicly, as with the forkable AWESOME repositories of list on Github helps people to learn how others learn, to learn how others express context.

# The Importance of Open Source Educational Materials

**The annotated reading lists which are posted will not include proprietary packages.**

We learn best from currently active, rapidly evolving open source knowledge communities ... we learn from the activity rather than the old dead materials -- this includes how we learn from the activity which has come after the ancient classics, ie it is more important to study the impact that the ancient classics have than it is to think one knows a historical factoid, eg it might be that Hesiod invented ancient timekeeping pieces out of necessity for needing to coordinate civilized activities, but why has coordinating time require that we still adhere to set times/places for meetings now that asynch communications and distributed organizations/talent are now optimal? The key here is what do active, important open source development communities look like -- sometimes we like conventions, but it is generally recognized now that a public space at Athens is not the ONLY way for a citizen to speak to a multi-lingual global community. 

Learning is not exactly about a factoid we come across in Wikipedia entry, but as the community processes of Wikipedia show, we must learn about how communities are learning and what resources those communities are developing. 

As open sourceists, we are concerned with studying and maybe improving open source learning projects. We look at how it works ... how participants read / review / discuss before they fork / revise / refactor / extend.ing open source knowledge ... as more people participate, the lack of any justification for proprietary, closed-source should either become more obvious to everyone OR otherwise, those associated with proprietary materials will have to add something other than the cachet of overcharging. 

Of course, smarter people now realize why the cost to purchase something has nothing to do with its value or that higher prices are used to trick people who do not bother to research purchases into rationalizing their faulty, unknowledgable evalations of status-driven purchases ... in educational knowledge resources, most of the value does not come from the quality of the printing or the stately campus, but instead comes from being involved some small way with others in building something larger, something that ***extends*** open source for others.
