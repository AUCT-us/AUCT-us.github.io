I have five Venture Areas.

  * [Collaborative AI](http://markbruns.github.io/collaborativeai/2017/12/15/Collaborative-AI.html)

  * [Distributied security](http://markbruns.github.io/distsec/2017/11/15/Distributed-Security.html)

  * [Financial technology](http://markbruns.github.io/fintech/2017/10/15/Financial-Technology.html)

  * [LEAN Quality](http://markbruns.github.io/leanquality/2017/09/15/Lean-Quality.html)

  * [Educational technology](http://markbruns.github.io/edtech/2017/09/15/Education-Technology.html)

The point of the different projects and side projects in these venture areas is primarily for me is learn how to learn better than I currently know how to learn ... in some cases, these may evolve into startups or economic enterprisess that complement business that I am already engaged in.  

To some degree or another, I also want these  things to have a tangible positive economic impact, ie to either lower my expenses OR to even become source of income. But the point of doing projects for me is not to get rich or to even immediately solve a problem ... I mainly use side projects to more aggressively interact with people who I find interesting, to accelerate my negotiations by having actual skin in the game, to get a more realistic, practical and useful understanding of problems ... maybe these ideas and investigations will amount to something, but mostly they are just about learning how to learn in order to be antifragile or to be ready to be able to make the best of uncertainty and chaos and possibly profit from or *enjoy* the world of problems.

#### Please suggest projects that I should be involved in; I will trust that you know how [use a pull request](https://github.com/MarkBruns/MarkBruns.github.io/pulls)

There's certainly nothing magic or particularly methodical about my approach ... it's pretty damned chaotic and disorganized ... and the list of things that I am working on is most definitely NOT as prioritized as it could be or should be ... I have containerized my time ... each day is blocked off into five different three-hour sessions, each session is for focusing on a particular venture area ... I do not keep a rigid schedule, but the venture area containers give me a structure or routine to go back to or to provide some semblence of routine and order, but my manner of managing my time using projects and automated Kanbans for issues associated with my venture area projects is still very much a work-in-process.  I recognize the need to adapt tools and methods to assist me in the process of continually working on making my ToDo list better, according to a more repeatable, higher quality standard workflow.
