I have five Venture Areas ... I am probably looking at pruning/consolidating to three ... but, so far, that sort of framework just does not work because pruning and elimination seems to involve giving up on important themes.

  * [Collaborative AI/MLops](http://markbruns.github.io/collaborativeai/2017/12/15/Collaborative-AI.html) ... I am excited about things like GitPod.io ... less excited about Google Colab, but hopeful ... more excited about companies like JetBrains with PyCharm and Datalore

  * [Distributied security](http://markbruns.github.io/distsec/2017/11/15/Distributed-Security.html) ... not that excited about gunsmithing tools for ghostguns and 3D printed guns anymore, but more excited about fitness and practical ways for abolition of any/all reliance by the masses on medicine/pharma, this includes encouraging martial arts lifestyles including throwbacks to old school traditional martial arts dojos as well as residential startup accelerators for fitness and minimalist lifestyle

  * [Financial exchanges](http://markbruns.github.io/fintech/2017/10/15/Financial-Technology.html) ... exchanges for locating and institutional frameworks for accelerating the negotiations that pertain to the three big things in any project/venture: calendar/time, requirements/scope, money/prioritization of value

  * [LEAN Quality](http://markbruns.github.io/leanquality/2017/09/15/Lean-Quality.html) ... using D.O.W.N.T.I.M.E. to first be able to SEE, then eliminate waste ... we might emphasize quality or value, in order to begin with no longer producing NON-VAULE-ADDED existences, NOISE and DEFECTS that people settle for, especially those that come out of a failure to achieve a shared understanding at the onset

  * [Educational disruption](http://markbruns.github.io/edtech/2017/09/15/Education-Technology.html) ... ISAs of Lambda School as well as the [Gradiance project completion methodology](https://www.gradiance.com/tutorials.html)
