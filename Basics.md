There are BASICS you should come back to and work on again and again ... it's a matter of "sharpening the saw" ... building proficiency with tools that you already use enough so that better knowledge will make your daily workflow more and more efficient.

The most BASIC thing of all is to develop your OWN list of 25 BASIC tools ... YOU should be in control of sharpening your own saw ... in the same way, that you should READ a LOT and developing YOUR [reading list](http://markbruns.github.io/ReadingList/) matters for *controlling the content in your projector*.  Of course, you can copy my list if you really want, but you should realize that you are copying from *the slow, wierd old guy* in the far right of extreme back of the very bottom of a class you might not want to be in.

1. Whether you want to admit it or not, most of the data-driven [IoT, gadget, mobile and web] world runs on [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction) [or it will soon use JS, even though somebody will always need to write stuff in C]. That means you need to be pretty darned familiar with the structure of the [ECMAScriptÂ®](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/) specification [as a *working* reference, not something to yak about with friends] and you should get yourself in the practice of writing GOOD, clear, solid, standard JS code [that others can use/re-use] according to good [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/tutorial.html) patterns.  Understanding good JavaScript will really help with interactions with other people in other communities who are working other things that have become essential things to know, like [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).
2. HTML, CSS and other front-end development technologies as well as back-end technologies necessary for [full-stack web development tools](https://www.lynda.com/learning-paths/Web/become-a-full-stack-web-developer) which are increasingly necessary for anyone serious about data visualization and [data-driven documents](https://d3js.org/). You might not ever become uber-proficient with HTML, CSS and the whole set of full-stack web dev technologies, but you have to be in the position of "having a clue what's going on" when pop open a "View Source" window because you want to know how a [data visualization] *magician* performed some [data visualization] *magic*.
3. [Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR433b0HJY), [the rationale for distributed control systems and the foundations of Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idLyobOhtO4), Git branching and merging, gitprime, gitflow, [Git mastery](https://github.com/progit/progit2), everything about Github such as [remote Github jobs](https://jobs.github.com/positions?description=&location=remote), the [GitHub blog](https://github.com/blog), the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/) and [Github's Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) ... taking Git to the [ProGit level](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and maybe [beyond in the fully-network effected GitHub social universe](https://youtu.be/DoQiiE5oNOU?list=PL0lo9MOBetEEUkazoHeLK7eVW-b2lyLwA)
4. Review code in Github repos in [Python](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=language%3APython&ref=searchresults&s=forks&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93), [R](https://github.com/search?l=&o=desc&q=language%3AR&ref=advsearch&s=forks&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93), [Scala](https://github.com/search?l=&o=desc&q=language%3AScala&ref=advsearch&s=forks&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93), [Go](https://github.com/search?l=&o=desc&q=language%3AGo&ref=advsearch&s=forks&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93), [C](https://github.com/search?l=&o=desc&q=language%3AC&ref=advsearch&s=forks&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93), [Ruby](https://github.com/search?l=&o=desc&q=language%3ARuby&ref=advsearch&s=forks&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93), [Lua](https://github.com/search?l=&o=desc&q=language%3ALua&ref=advsearch&s=forks&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93) ... look at crowd-curated [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) lists on Github, eg JosephMisiti's [Awesome-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning) ... understand the [Conda history and community ecosystem developments](https://speakerdeck.com/teoliphant/packaging-and-deployment-with-conda) reflected in the [conda-forge community on Github](https://github.com/conda-forge), the different [Conda-available feedstocks](https://conda-forge.github.io/feedstocks.html) and even the [typical misconceptions others have about Conda](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/) as a general-purpose package management system ... be more familiar with the entire [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) community for developing and extending open source technology for interactive data science and scientific computing across over 40 programming languages.
5. Look at social media and platforms for managing social media like [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/dashboard) to [effectively network professionally](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/manage-your-job/9781680501377/chap14.xhtml) and manage the ROI of your social media as you LISTEN with analytics and tracking tools.  Also, look at the world of writing and publishing [beyond microblogging and blogging]; evaluate ASCIIdoctor, Amazon or O'Reilly Atlas publishing platforms
6. Look at important cultural developments in networking and establishing TRUST, eg. [Bitcoin](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin/9781491902639/) technological stack and how it has driven culture and cryptocurrencies; study the distributed, decentralized architecture of [blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb68nxJHvj10JvS-lebOb-FHHeWUMpwKO) database technology
7. Lifehack, find ways to optimize your workflow, your calendars, your todo lists, your inboxes; do a better job of using chat especially if connected to repositories, capture notes ... realizie that there are 86,400 seconds per day; appreciate every one of them by scrupulously and diligently managing and optimizing the value of your TIME
8. Become more fit, become tougher, find ways to eliminate your health/wellness weaknesses
9. Become more aware of nutrition, cooking, nutrigenomics; sample your microbiome
10. Become more proficient at communication especially alternatives to driving/flying to meetings and conferences; when you don't have a way out, make better use of your time at meetings and conferences
11. Look into video production as well as video surveillance and video security; control your projector; do not passively consume content from others
12. Become proficient at photography and the use of cameras, especially the cameras on your phone.
13. Study cryptography, steganography, hashing, security
14. [Algorithms](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/algorithms-fourth-edition/9780132762564/), [Conway's Law](https://youtu.be/Lwdhw8aI8es?list=PL055Epbe6d5YhDchEvY3O4nIuSLYyrx7K) and thinking algorithmically
15. Mathematics, statistics, physics ... for their own sake ... just because
16. Become more proficient in using your editor, your terminal application, the notebook applications [like Jupyter] and other cross-platform applications using Electron
17. Work at mastery of the healing and martial arts
18. Study meditation and lojong techniques
19. Appreciate nature without any political bullshit or biases or filters ... raise worms, become a beekeeper, grow a garden in order to be part of nature
20. Appreciate art for the art's sake (not necessarily because you like it or it pleases you); listen to music for the music's sake
21. Learn new databases, concurrency frameworks, languages, RT/FT/security kernels for operating systems
22. Cooking, food, agriculture, soils, gardening, microbrewing, opengermplasm
23. Enjoy history, biography, philosophy, political economy, social choice theory
24. Pay attention to pop culture, fashion, counterculture ... and of course, [workplace or work culture](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/03/13/culture-why-its-the-hottest-topic-in-business-today/)
25. **IGNORE most news and current events** ... pay attention to what "pushes your buttons" and avoid it; develop a proficiency for ignoring what people WANT to use to manipulate or scare you ... 99.999% of the world's windsocks are filled with clickbait blowhards and other forms of mindwasting employed by noospheric parasites in media.



# Always think about and look for new ideas to employ LEAN thinking

It's not just about NEW "lean enterprise" thinking and ideas like the "minimum viable product" idea that goes to the heart of stripping away the unnecessary and ONLY doing things to maximize the stream of VALUE for customers or to optimize customer satisfaction when setting up a new business interface.

In your existing businesses and operations, use your D.O.W.N.T.I.M.E. in order recognize all of the forms of WASTE that creep into our lives.

- D: Do not produce Defects ... a Defect is defined as an outcome that is less than the best that is possible to produce; do not EVER be less than the very BEST you can be ... when you have not been at your best, STOP!  Refuse to ever persist in leading a defective life.

- O: Do not engage in Overproduction; do not produce for the sake of produce anything, even if it's the wrong thing ... it is HARD to find the right thing, but do not waste your life / effort / energy producing low-quality commodity goods and services ... find what you're good at and produce excellence, work HARD producing, do what you love most.

- W: Do not tolerate Waiting for the right thing to be done; don't make others Wait ... be impatient and demanding, do not settle for crap, take chances and risk making enemies with those who want to produce waste and make others wait.  LEAD!  Take on risks and manage difficult situations in order to enhance and expedite the creation of excellence and value
- N: Do not be someone who is Not Listening to other people's concerns and  ideas ...be the grownup adult who people really TRUST ... be genuinely empathetic, be persistently optimistic.  Expect growth from people. Be the coach in tough, big games who believes and encourages, who keeps his head in the game until the end and who devises a practice strategy for next week on the way home.

- T: Transportation of waste is even worst than stationary waste ...  don't just wander around aimlessly in life, shuffling your shit from one dead end job to the next.  IMPLEMENT your vision by DRIVING forward looking far ahead, never backward or second-guessing like backseat driver.  Think long-term and logistically so that you do not just drive around looking for what you might find

- I: Inventory [of everything] is not an asset, it's baggage that constrains independence ... LIVE CHEAPLY, consume less than anyone you know, be more fit, eliminate your addictions and bad habits, get rid of needy people in your life by helping others to become more independent and mindful

- M: Motion or doing something for the sake of looking busy is for idiots ... THINK first ... PLAN-DO-CHECK-ACT ... Doing things is essential, but if you don't Plan first, you will do the wrong things and do them badly, if you don't Check on what you have done, ie ask "does it satisfy the customer?" you shouldn't keep doing anything and finally it is extra essential to ACT when a plan, an implementation or quality checks are not producing value

- E: Producing Extra features, extra complexity or extra nonsense is waste ... develop the Minimum Viable Product ... as you perfect and simplify product, do the simplest thing that can fix the root cause of what customers see as the product's MAIN failing ... maintain simple, great products; SERVE customers not your ego.  Avoid doing anything just to impress others. Add requirements, features, flourishes increases scopes, difficulties and costs.

As you 5S your workflow/business/life, think about Ohno's 38 lessons from the Toyota Production System and how those lessons apply to you

1. Wise Mend Their Ways - Correcting and refining your ideas, fail in a small way ... develop a sense of humility. Learning to fail is a prerequisite for having the power of persuasion as a true leader.

2. If You Are Wrong, Admit It - The Japanese word sakkaku refers to optical illusions, reasonable misconceptions or conclusions that we might jump to ... it OK to get it wrong. A funny thing happens when "the boss's" ideas fail publicly ...when a leader RAPIDLY admit that his ideas were wrong, he actually inspires other people to be more creative, to be wrong.

3. Misconceptions Reduce Efficiency - Efficiently working up a sweat to appear busy is not the same as efficiently producing something of value.

4. Confirm Failures With Your Own Eyes - OWN what is going on, especially when it comes to how the failure happens -- do not ever delegate failure to someone else.

5. Misconceptions Hidden Within Common Sense - Human beings doing work have misconceptions about goals and constraint that seem perfectly sensible and reasonable, but the limit to what we can accomplish is set by what the herd views as a sensible limit.

6. The Blind Spot in Mathematical Calculations - Costs exist in order to be reduced or eliminated, not simply calculated. Never tolerate any cost or waste and simply keep expecting it and calculating it with the notion of "It is what it is." Instead ask, "WHY do we have that cost? At all?"

7. Don't Fear Opportunity Losses - Do not be a sucker when it comes to missing the next big thing! Think instead in terms of fragility and anti-fragility ... protect against downside while setting yourself up for an infinite upside and expansion that involve "good problems to have."

8. Limited Volume Production Is To Produce At Low Cost - Lose fat, and build muscle, especially to improve the ability to lose fat and build muscle in the future. Do not lose muscle and build fat because you have become good at hiding fat.

9. Reduced Inventory, Increased Work In Process - Be careful of local optimization at the expense of the global optimum. Always be conscious of the larger goal. Beware of your accountants, especially when they are wielding tax codes and depreciation schedules.

10. The Misconception that Mass Production Is Cheaper - Bigger is probably never better, especially for companies starting out ... bigger makes no sense whatsoever until you are essentially forced to get bigger to serve a demand that is insatiable.

11.  Wasted Motion Is Not Work - Make sure that what you are doing is not simply masturbation, unless that's really what you want to do.

12. Agricultural People Like Inventory - Do NOT think like the farmers who are mesmerized by massive piles of GMO grain sitting on a pile waiting to be turned into an inferior product mandated by a communist renewable fuel standard ... unless you want to work for a guaranteed welfare check and not think a lot about your future.

13. Improve Productivity With Reduced Volumes - get it right in small batches.

14. Do Kaizen When Times Are Good - improve like a fiend when you don't have to

15. Just In Time - JIT EVERYTHING, JIT all of your thought processes ... training for example -- ditch classrooms, instead teach in the shop, on the bench in the lab, out in the field.

16. Old Man Sakichi Toyoda' Jikoda Idea - shut it down if it aint working for everybody ... right now.

17. The Goal Was Ten Times Higher Productivity - don't settle for doubling productivity ... think completely different and encourage EVERYONE to encourage EVERYONE to think different.

18. The Supermarket System - Devise systems and then tear them up and make them better.

19. Toyota Made the Kanban System Possible - Get in shape so that you can be in good enough shape to get in better shape. Never stop getting better.

20. We Learned Forging Changeover at Toyota do Brasil - Ditch your pride. Learn from people who are not supposed to have any way possible to get their work done as efficiently as you do, but still beat you. Steal ideas from everywhere.

21. Rationalization is To Do What Isn't Rational - If the system is not broken, break it.

22. Shut the Machines Off! - Don't load up on equipment or automate, simplify.

23.  How To Produce At Lower Cost - THINK. Expect people to THINK.

24. Fight The Robot Fad - Sometimes work isn't supposed to be easy; it is supposed to be eliminated.

25. Work Is A Competition of Wits With Subordinates - PUSH, cajole, praise, intimidate, taunt, love, motivate the people who you are a mentor to ... become a mentor to ALL of your subordinates.

26. There Are No Supervisors At Administrative Gemba - What is a layer of management for except to build homes for weasels?

27. We Can Still Do A Lot More Kaizen - 1) We are only now getting to the point where we can see how much more we have left to do. 2) #1 will always be true.

28. Wits Don't Work Until You Feel The Squeeze - Necessity is the mother of invention. Cortez burned his ship so that his men had to fight the Aztecs that they feared.

29. Become A Reliable Boss - PREDICTABLY expect others to THINK; PREDICTABLY demand that others expect people around them to THINK.

30. Sort, Set In Order, Sweep, Sanitize - AND Standardize ... 5S

31. There Is A Correct Sequence To Kaizen - Reduce the biggest costs so that you have money and resources to reduce smaller cost.

32. Operational Availability vs. Rate Of Operation -Actual rate of operation achieved matters -- it is should be obvious enough that a process that produce at a high rate is useless if it routinely is unavailable.

33. The Difference Between Production Engineering and Manufacturing Engineering - Mfg Engineering is practical, hands-on and more valuable in TPS; Production Engineering launches new product, new facilities and must remember that it serves Mfg Engineering ... not the other way around.

34. The Pitfall of Cost Calculation - Stop calculating, start reducing

35. The Monaka System - Invest in good "equipment" that can be maintained and extended, then tear it down and re-use the good parts -- do not pay any attention to depreciation schedules or proprietary crap that cannot be maintained or extended

36. Only Gemba Can Do Cost Reduction - NO CONSULTANTS ... cost reductions has gotta be done by the PEOPLE in production who know what they are doing.

37. Follow The Decisions That Were Made - See the decision through, stick with it, if it was a bad decision, learn as much as possible so that the mistake is not repeated.

38. The Shortest Time Should Be The Standard Time - Hopefully, this is obvious enough ... but many different constituencies want to pad the standard work so that goals are easy to hit ... no sandbagging.
