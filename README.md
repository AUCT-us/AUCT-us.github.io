Christian mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) techniques starting with basic breathwork and relaxation techniques ... and then building on the basic **sign of the cross**...

## Christian MBSR is entirely built from the ground up on everything that drives a careful, mindfull **sign of the cross**. 

Start with basic breathwork, either box-breathing methods for diaphagmatic breathing or the “4-7-8” breathing technique … make the **sign of the cross** *mindfully* with extra care, slowly ...  as you make the sign, you will do 4-7-8 breath cycle ... first, a four-count (as you touch your forehead) - a seven-count (as you touch your heart) - then an eight count (as you touch each shoulder) ... coordinate your breathing cycle with your physical motions and your intentional prayer … PRAY the sign of the cross, starting with a four-count INHALE, think about all of your blessings, IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER … holding your breath for seven counts, contemplate the fullness of the mysteries of Jesus Christ … do a final eight-count long exhale as you contemplate the meaning of Resurrection, the new Creation and everything thereafter through the Holy Spirit and the expansion of the faithful through the church and celebration of the sacrements.

As you breathe, you should notice how your diaphram pushes your belly out to fully engage in mediatative diaphagmatic breathing. Diaphramatic breathing is foundation of meditative breathing techniques, so you must have a grounding in diaphramatic breathing before wasting time prematurely moving on to the basic MBSR body scan meditation, followed perhaps by Hatha yoga and postures that help you to relax and breathe more deeply, then move on to guided meditation [via something like the Hallow app or similar], then experiment on your own with longer forms of meditation which work for you. Prayerwalking [without audio distractions] is one thing that might helpful, going to daily mass and arriving early to spend time in prayer beforehand might be something else to try. Experiment … but, above all, give these things some repititions and TIME for them to work … use a charitable mindset to encourage results, ie at first, fake it, until you make it; but there’s no need to beat a dead horse … just be a little patient*.

Re-establish your connection to your Catholic religious practices and the larger community of the faithful who share your appreciation for Catholic traditions. Don’t just go to daily mass, but pray the rosary and explore other ways to deepen your faith and grow in your relationship with the larger body of believers.
