I LOVE competition.

I follow a lot of different competitive technologies ... in war, technology, culture, propaganda and even sometimes in some sports that are actually about competition and participatory improvement ... that's why I strongly prefer wrestling, jiujitsu and traditional martial art forms over ball sports or motor sports that seem to primarily be suited for teevee watchers or very large audiences because they entertain spectators rather involve participants, eg NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB.

Mostly, I strongly favor ACTIVE, PARTICIPATORY, REAL competition ... and there are some particularly intense competitions in nerdy, non-athletic realms. I have never had much of a significant interest in computer gaming *and just playing games* EXCEPT THAT the hacking, building gaming rigs and new technological companies, eg NVIDIA, Oculus, et al, built by computer gamers is FASCINATING. The competitive participatory DIY sport of gaming rig builds and tweeking the tech for greater computational speed is definitely about ACTIVE, PARTICIPATORY, REAL competition.

## Overcoming *not-invented-here* Weakness Syndrome 

It is a particularly STUPID time to be either idea averse OR to be full of ignorant pride to be able to appreciate the wider world of more and more ideas.

Reading is about accelerating the competition of competition, by a factor of 1000X or 1,000,000X or 1,000,000,000X ... to get radically more, radically better competition.

The world is about to get 1000X more competitive than it has been in the last few decades, thanks to AI finally delivering on some its promise ... although the internetworked and increasingly mobile world we had decades of the 2000s and 2010 was easily been 1,000X more competitive than the backward, inbred times of best of mass-media or cableTV culture of the 1980 and 1990s. 

It's not just that the electronic bid-ask spread in financial markets made capital flows much more competitive than open outcry trading that happened in the street. We now live in a compute-enabled economy dominated by savvy adapters who have mastered the use of the inference engines in their AIphone apps ... people no longer really have the excuse of making the same bad choices they made yesterday.

The global auction never ceases ... so people don't have to pay attention to spectator shit UNLESS they want to choose to be SPECTATOR prey. The implicit accelerated negotiations embedding in such information-rich, compute-intensive markets will radically intensify competition ... in the same way that online retailers have replaced physical stores which encouraged people to grab a shopping cart and explore the store.

**There WILL be people who choose to lose because of how they will aggressively avoid AI-ified reading technologies are intensifying competition that comes from the world of more and more and ideas.**

I choose to get more ideas.  I READ in order to get more ideas faster ... to see how things are done better somewhere else or to understand the strategies that have worked well in the past. 

I also want to read in order to write better ... I write and revise, edit, refactor and write more in order to be immersed in the world of ideas ... I monkey around with podcasts in order to improve my writing and to make my reading that much more productive -- I podcast, write, read **in order to PARTICIPATE in the world of ideas** ... although I might live amongst people who seem to be idea averse, I don't need watch teevee or drink alcohol or drive vehicles or do other things that accelerated progressions into stupidity.

I am an intensely competitive reader in that I **really try** to be speedreaders, *although I still suck at it* ... I skim thousands of abstracts from the preprint Arxivs ... I even participate in Wikipedia editing in order to understand **directly** something about how consensus is reached in *information wars* ... I have seen how intelligent people are aggressively choosing to waste far less of their time in vehicles, preferring instead to travel in the realm of information and ideas ... the world is rapidly becoming more heavily populated by EXTREMELY HEAVY consumers of data, information, fora interaction, [inane] commentary and various repositories of code, models, papers and demo sandboxes ... the intensely competitive nature of our economies is based upon how the people who drive opinions adapt technologies to their needs to grok information that is pertinent to the competitive games we are participating in.

# Reading is for COMPETITORS; Competition is for readers

Of course, I also read and curate lists ... just for fun, just as a break from work ... TO JUST RELAX ... but, even when we relax, we do try to use reading aids like multimodal AI to give us outlines or syllabi ... so that we can speedread *with serious, critical intention* TO IMPROVE OUR OVERALL ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE ***READING*** GAME. 

## Listification is about the competitive SIEVE of ideas

The COMPETITIVE SIEVE of ideas starts with a FULL hopper of ideas ... because the FULLNESS of the hopper is what gives us the comparability necessary to prioritize and to make choices about what to read and annotate ... it's impossible to have ONE idea that is REALLY and important topic that is more worthwhile than others, if you have not sorted and prioritized down through the sieves, funnels and hoppers of 250 topic areas to get 50 areas of focus, through 50 areas of focus to 10 qualified leads, 10 qualified ideas to close in on ONE good, solid idea.  

Our aim with this listing is to never have to think about our next list of items to read/annotate ... we want to have roughly 250 to 125 good game ideas in the hopper ... to have 50 to 25 that we play with and work on at least once a month ... to have five or ten that are part of our daily drills and things we are certain revisit at least once a week ... so that we can have ONE main GAME that we are focusing on getting right.

2) Prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, long projects, meditation especially techniques like lojong 

3) Martial arts, self-defense, healing, yoga, tai chi, qigong, modern medicine vs traditional medicine, systematic improvement in health and exercise

4) Startup ecosystems, startup nations, not just the billion-dollar valuation unicorns but successful startups that make it to having a legitimate ten-million-dollar or million-dollar valuation, e-residency and virtual realm cultures that tap new global markets and pools of talent

5) The art of knowledge engineering, information dashboards and newsreaders for drinking from the firehose of peer-reviewed scientific journals and similar sources of current research and development activities 

6) Ecosystems, nature, not just parks and green spaces but the microscopic realm

7) Sculpture, particularly landsculpting, sustainable architecture [built to last hundreds/thousands of years, not just modern trash quick fab housing built to last a several decades or a century at most]

8) Meta Wikipedia, rabid wikipedians, the more general culture of online fora and combative debate of which wikiediting culture might be the best example

9) Classics and commentary, the culture of literature, poetry and the purification of language, philosophy and theology

10) Physicis, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology 

11) Computer Science and AI vs Unabomber Manifest, NLP, Computer Vision, Swarm Robotics and AIoT, Automation vs Simplification, Cybersecurity and the limits of cryptography, Quantum Computing, Metaverse and augmented reality, Smart Infrastructure vs Natural/Emergent [No] Infrastructure

12) Podcastering, DAWs, audio ... and cultural participation through the audio realm ... generally, we detest vidiots and the zombified culture of people programmed by their media choices in the visual realm ... in other words, we view audio as something we might listen to while RESTING ... we are completely uninteresting any anything that we passively watch while being entertained ... when we want to be entertained or completely immersed in a distracting experience, we DO physical activities, drills/calisthenics and things like gardening.

13) Music, Music AI and recommendation engines, Music metadata and signature analysis, music theory and the culture of music, music as a form of communication and a form of cultural PARTICIPATION ... we generally eschew any form of spectator culture ... we have no interest in being part of large mob watching a celebrity perform ... IF THERE'S ANY FORM OF CELEBRITY AND CELEBRITY WORSHIP INVOLVED, WE REGARD THE ACTIVITY AS POISON
