## Mark's List
These are things that I want to learn or share with others.  Generally speaking, the things on my list are things that I have done, things that I am still trying to do and things that I think are important to do, but I need to do them a lot better ... I will not claim to be good at doing them, but I will claim that I have looked into the topics more seriously than most [but not all!] people I meet ... I am interested presenting the topics, because I would benefit from the reactions and feedback of others -- not because I am a master at these things or that I have something to sell
