<p>There is gigantic temptation to arrogantly believe in one's own competence ... or worse to believe in relying on a silver bullet or magic or faith.  There is NO PERFECT SECURITY in this lifetime. It is possible to have a relative sense of security, ie enough peace to sleep at night, but it is stupid to believe that holes in security will not be found and vulnerabilities exploited.</p>

<p>It is impossible to ever be lean enough, rugged enough, secure enough ... achieving perfection in these realms is thoroughly unattainable in this life ... but as long as you want to live and to help others live, you must still keep trying.</p>

<pre><code>Without humility, your faith in anything is PURE BULLSHIT.</pre></code>

<p>Many fail to understand why humility is so important.  Most Christians, for example, fail to understand WHY there can be no salvation without grace ... there's no way to ever do enough, to believe enough, to pray enough, to go to church enough, to trust God enough ... there's nothing a human can do to be saved -- salvation is a matter of grace.</p>

<p><b>At some point, it is necessary for adults to grow up -- this means that they must stop believing in fairy tales!</b></p>

<p>The essence of being a warrior is never giving up on yourself while realizing that you will always be committed to improving levels of security ... improving levels of security is why warriors were created -- they were NOT created to brag about war exploits or about successes or battle scars -- a warrior is ALWAYS training for the NEXT FIGHT ... talking about old fights, old battles, old wars is the mark of impotence and stagnation ... <i>more on this later posts...<i></p>
